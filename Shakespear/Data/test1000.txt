 well said , lord sands ;your colts tooth is not cast yet . 
 tell him myself , the mayor , and aldermen , no less importing than our general good , in deep designs , and matters of great moment are come to have some conference with his grace . 
 yes , shylock , i will seal unto this bond . 
 when would you use it ? pray , sir , tell me that . 
 the marshal of france , monsieur la far . 
 woe , woe for england ! not a whit for me , for i , too fond , might have prevented this . 
 alas , poor romeo ! he is already dead , stabbed with a white wench’s black eye , shot through the ear with a love song , 
 a special virtue : for then she need not be washedand scoured . 
 a man , they say , that from very nothing , and beyond the imagination of his neighbours , is grown into an unspeakable estate . 
 true or false , it hath made thee earl of gloucester . seek out where thy father is , that he may be ready for our apprehension . 
 what says that fool of hagar’s offspring , ha ? 
 behind the tuft of pines i met them ; neversaw i men scour so on their way : i eyed themeven to their ships . 
 so could i too . 
 i would you were set , so your affection would cease . 
 enough ; i read your fortune in your eye .was this the idol that you worship so ? 
 when the mind’s free , the body’s delicate . the tempest in my mind doth from my senses take all feeling else save what beats there—filial ingratitude . 
 ( aside ) excellent wench , say i . 
 and , with my best endeavours in your absence , your discontenting father strive to qualify and bring him up to liking . 
 no , madam ; so it stead you , i will writeplease you command , a thousand times as much ; and yet— 
 you have seen sunshine and rain at once—her smiles and tears were like a better way . 
 do you hear , sir ? 
 i doubt not but his friends will turn to us . 
 put your main cause into the kings protection ; hes loving and most gracious : twill be much both for your honour better and your cause ; 
 sure , you have some hideous matter to deliver , when thecourtesy of it is so fearful . speak your office . 
 tomorrow , then , we will attend your grace , and so most joyfully we take our leave . 
 and so still think of the wrong i did myself ; which was so much , that heirless it hath made my kingdom and destroyd the sweetst companion that eer man bred his hopes out of . 
 but he hath conjured me beyond them , and i must needs appear . 
 welcome , dear proteus ! mistress , i beseech you ,confirm his welcome with some special favour . 
 here’s a good world the while . who is so gross that cannot see this palpable device ? 
 orsino . i have heard my father name him . he was a bachelor then . 
 proceed . 
 mistress , look out at window , for all this . 
 thus margaret’s curse falls heavy upon my neck : “when he ,” quoth she , “shall split thy heart with sorrow , remember margaret was a prophetess .”— 
 so shall you feel the loss , but not the friendwhich you weep for . 
 i will not rise unless your highness hear me . 
 well , peace be with you , sir . here comes my man . 
 the sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears , thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears . lo , here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit of an old tear that is not washed off yet . 
 having been three months married to her , sitting in my state— 
 now he goes with no less presence but with much more love than young alcides , when he did redeem the virgin tribute paid by howling troy to the sea monster . 
 go to my steward . 
 my back a’ t’ other side . ah , my back , my back ! beshrew your heart for sending me about , to catch my death with jaunting up and down ! 
 ah , for our father , for our dear lord clarence ! 
 i will return again into the house and desire some conduct of the lady . 
 if i chance to talk a little wild , forgive me ; i had it from my father . 
 her natural posture ! 
 marry , sir , sometimes he is a kind of puritan . 
 remember our reward when the deed’s done . 
 not sound , i say . 
 of gloucester’s treachery and of the loyal service of his son , when i informed him , then he called me “sot ,” and told me i had turned the wrong side out . 
 let them have scope , though what they will impart help nothing else , yet do they ease the heart . 
 alack , what heinous sin is it in me to be ashamed to be my father’s child ! 
 unto the white , upturnèd , wondering eyes of mortals that fall back to gaze on him when he bestrides the lazy -puffing clouds and sails upon the bosom of the air . 
 what , by a horseman , or a footman ? 
 the slip , sir , the slip . can you not conceive ? 
 how cheerest thou , jessica ? and now , good sweet , say thy opinion . how dost thou like the lord bassanio’s wife ? 
 o , no , he loves me , and he holds me dear .go you to him from me . 
 and thy parts sovereign and pious else , could speak thee out , the queen of earthly queens : 
 if i had thee in lipsbury pinfold , i would make thee care for me . 
 approach , sir andrew . not to be abed after midnight is to be up betimes , and diluculo surgere , thou know’st ,— 
 but , sir , sir , hear me , sir thomas : youre a gentleman of mine own way ; i know you wise , religious ; 
 sweetly in force unto her fair life’s end . 
 marry , my lord , lest by a multitude the new -healed wound of malice should break out , which would be so much the more dangerous by how much the estate is green and yet ungoverned . 
 had you not been their father , these white flakes did challenge pity of them . was this a face to be opposed against the warring winds ? 
 therefore , be abhorrd all feasts , societies , and throngs of men ! his semblable , yea , himself , timon disdains : destruction fang mankind ! earth , yield me roots ! 
 good your graces , let me have time and counsel for my cause : alas , i am a woman , friendless , hopeless ! 
 you will not then ? 
 is she not passing fair ? 
 theres fresher air , my lord ,in the next chamber . 
 that they are out by lease . 
 amen . 
 wherefore , bold peasant , darest thou support a published traitor ? 
 a satire against the softness of prosperity , with a discovery of the infinite flatteries that follow youth and opulency . 
 willt please you , sir , be gone ? i told you what would come of this : beseech you , of your own state take care : this dream of mine ,— being now awake , ill queen it no inch farther , but milk my ewes and weep . 
 nay , my lord ,that cannot be : you are a counsellor ,and , by that virtue , no man dare accuse you . 
 that cannot be . his ring i do accept most thankfully . 
 as she lived peerless , so her dead likeness , i do well believe , excels whatever yet you lookd upon or hand of man hath done ; 
 happy were england would this virtuous prince take on his grave the sovereignty thereof . 
 prove true , imagination , oh , prove true , that i , dear brother , be now taen for you ! 
 stay , my lord , and let your reason with your choler question what tis you go about : to climb steep hills requires slow pace at first : 
 you are welcome . take your place .are you acquainted with the differencethat holds this present question in the court ? 
 oppressèd nature sleeps .— 
 but how camest thou by this ring ? at my departi gave this unto julia . 
 and thy advice this night ill put in practise . therefore , sweet proteus , my direction -giver , let us into the city presently to sort some gentlemen well skilld in music . 
 i will , my lord . 
 but for thee , fellow . fellow , thy words are madness : three months this youth hath tended upon me ; but more of that anon . 
 and soam i to you . 
 ay , pilgrim , lips that they must use in prayer . 
 for me ?must i go like a traitor thither ? 
 is this well spoken now ? 
 what was purposed concerning his imprisonment , was rather , if there be faith in men , meant for his trial , and fair purgation to the world , than malice , im sure , in me . 
 but he , poor man , by your first order died , and that a wingèd mercury did bear . 
 so are you , sweet , even in the lovely garnish of a boy . 
 to do this deed , promotion follows . 
 shall they see us ? 
 under what title shall i woo for thee , that god , the law , my honor and her love can make seem pleasing to her tender years ? 
 glancing an eye of pity on his losses that have of late so huddled on his back eno to press a royal merchant down and pluck commiseration of his state from brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint , from stubborn turks and tartars never trained to offices of tender courtesy . 
 what you will , to dismiss it . 
 so the were bleeding -new , my lord , theres no meatlike em : i could wish my best friend at such a feast . 
 your grace ,i fear , with dancing is a little heated . 
 prithee , read i thy right wits . 
 two households , both alike in dignity in fair verona , where we lay our scene , from ancient grudge break to new mutiny , where civil blood makes civil hands unclean . 
 nay , good troth . 
 well -a -day that you were , sir . 
 i see this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive . what an exchange had this been without boot ! what a boot is here with this exchange ! 
 before the days of change , still is it so . by a divine instinct , men’s minds mistrust ensuing dangers , 
 i wonder that such a keech can with his very bulk take up the rays o the beneficial sun and keep it from the earth . 
 i warrant you , my lord . 
 ay , my lord ; even soas it is here set down . 
 so . 
 do you think , my lords ,the king will suffer but the little fingerof this man to be vexd ? 
 thou hast a servant named lucilius . 
 those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears , shamed their aspect with store of childish drops . 
 that , by killing of villains , thou wast born to conquer my country . 
 and why not death rather than living torment ? to die is to be banishd from myself ; and silvia is myself : banishd from her is self from self : a deadly banishment ! 
 o , gods will ! much better she neer had known pomp : thought be temporal , 
 a little scrubbèd boy no higher than thyself , the judge’s clerk , a prating boy that begged it as a fee . 
 he knows not what he says , and vain it isthat we present us to him . 
 not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy and vengeance bitter ; but those that are germane to him , though removed fifty times , shall all come under the hangman : 
 why , so hath this , both by the father and mother . 
 my husband lives , that tybalt would have slain , and tybalt’s dead , that would have slain my husband . all this is comfort . wherefore weep i then ? 
 for he would needs be virtuous : that good fellow , if i command him , follows my appointment : 
 i cannot speak , nor think nor dare to know that which i know . 
 thou art a strange fellow . a tailor make a man ? 
 camillo , sir ; i spake with him ; who now has these poor men in question . 
 she is too fair , too wise , wisely too fair , to merit bliss by making me despair . 
 , as , i confess , there is no woe to his correction , 
 he is a stone , a very pebble stone , and has no more pity in him than a dog : a jew would have wept to have seen our parting ; why , my grandam , having no eyes , look you , wept herself blind at my parting . 
 what a caterwauling do you keep here ! 
 [to the secretary] let there be letters writ to every shire , of the kings grace and pardon . the grieved commons hardly conceive of me ; 
 so thou apprehendest it : take it for thy labour . 
 what is his name ? 
 after my death i wish no other herald , no other speaker of my living actions , to keep mine honour from corruption , but such an honest chronicler as griffith . 
 well , we shall then know more ; and buckinghamshall lessen this big look . 
 sir paris , i will make a desperate tender of my child’s love . i think she will be ruled in all respects by me . nay , more , i doubt it not .— 
 with another , fortying his new shoes with old ribbon ? and yet thou wilt tutor me from quarreling ! 
 may it please your grace ,— 
 i could not personally deliver to her what you commanded me , but by her woman i sent your message ; 
 good time of day unto my gracious lord . 
 where is gentle rivers , vaughan , grey ? 
 where the devil should this romeo be ?came he not home tonight ? 
 thy lips rot off ! 
 i know of none , nor know i you by voice or any feature . 
 we have always truly served you , and beseech you so to esteem of us , and on our knees we beg , as recompense of our dear services past and to come , that you do change this purpose , 
 sir , your glove . 
 the selfsame name , but one of better nature . 
 i dare be sworn these dangerous unsafe lunes i the king , beshrew them ! 
 to make an act of tragic violence . edward , my lord , thy son , our king , is dead . 
 i , madam ? 
 a thousand times good night ! 
 bid my guard watch . leave me . ratcliffe , about the mid of night come to my tentand help to arm me . leave me , i say . 
 fool , fool , fool , i say ! 
 he is in heaven , where thou shalt never come . 
 towards chertsey , noble lord ? 
 oh , ’twill be admirable ! 
 give us the place alone . we will hear this divinity . 
 if our betters play at that game , we must not dare to imitate them ; faults that are rich are fair . 
 two women placed together makes cold weather : my lord sands , you are one will keep em waking ; pray , sit between these ladies . 
 this trusty servant shall pass between us . ere long you are like to hear— if you dare venture in your own behalf— a mistress’s command . 
 o upright judge !—mark , jew .—o learnèd judge ! 
 o , this is full of pity ! sir , it calls ,i fear , too many curses on their headsthat were the authors . 
 what , are they broken ? 
 am i like such a fellow ? 
 she is damned for it . 
 but , god be thanked , there is no need of me , and much i need to help you , were there need . 
 i would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever knapped ginger or made her neighbors believe she wept for the death of a third husband . 
 have not alone employd you where high profits might come home , but pared my present havings , to bestow my bounties upon you . 
 my prayers on the adverse party fight , and there the little souls of edward’s children whisper the spirits of thine enemies and promise them success and victory . 
 for his particular i’ll receive him gladly ,but not one follower . 
 noble ventidius ! well ; i am not of that feather to shake off my friend when he must need me . 
 and so will i . 
 here , madam , at your service . 
 o joy , een made away ere t can be born ! mine eyes cannot hold out water , methinks : to forget their faults , i drink to you . 
 but if you please to shoot another arrow that self way which you did shoot the first , i do not doubt , as i will watch the aim , or to find both or bring your latter hazard back again and thankfully rest debtor for the first . 
 hastings and edward’s children , grey and rivers , holy king henry and thy fair son edward , vaughan , and all that have miscarrièd by underhand , corrupted , foul injustice , 
 one being dead , i shall have more than you can dream of yet ; 
 a piteous corse , a bloody piteous corse . pale , pale as ashes , all bedaubed in blood , all in gore blood . i swoonèd at the sight . 
 alas , how love can trifle with itself ! here is her picture : let me see ; i think , if i had such a tire , this face of mine were full as lovely as is this of hers : and yet the painter flatterd her a little , unless i flatter with myself too much . 
 how with mine honor may i give him thatwhich i have given to you ? 
 what was your dream , my lord ? i pray you tell me . 
 one would think his mother’smilk were scarce out of him . 
 a pound of man’s flesh taken from a man is not so estimable , profitable neither , as flesh of muttons , beefs , or goats . 
 the clock struck nine when i did send the nurse . in half an hour she promised to return . perchance she cannot meet him . that’s not so . 
 and ask no other dowry with her but such another jest . 
 in celebration of this day with shows , pageants and sights of honour . 
 more wonderful , when angels are so angry . 
 o , swear not by the moon , th’ inconstant moon , that monthly changes in her circle orb ,lest that thy love prove likewise variable . 
 o valentine , this i endure for thee ! 
 why , “some are born great , some achieve greatness , and some have greatness thrown upon them .” i was one , sir , in this interlude , one sir topas , sir , but that’s all one . 
 wherein , although , my good lord cardinal , they vent reproaches most bitterly on you , as putter on of these exactions , yet the king our master— 
 and , sure , those men are happy that shall have em . the last is , for my men ; they are the poorest , but poverty could never draw em from me ; 
 know’st thou the way to dover ? 
 sir eglamour , i would to valentine , to mantua , where i hear he makes abode ; and , for the ways are dangerous to pass , i do desire thy worthy company , upon whose faith and honour i repose . 
 this feather stirs . she lives . if it be so , it is a chance which does redeem all sorrowsthat ever i have felt . 
 my lord ? 
 turio , give back , or else embrace thy death ; come not within the measure of my wrath ; do not name silvia thine ; if once again , verona shall not hold thee . 
 tomorrow , sir . best first go see your lodging . 
 but i know thou art no tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be drunk : 
 take the boy to you : he so troubles me ,tis past enduring . 
 i am bid forth to supper , jessica . there are my keys .— 
 that subtle traitor this day had plotted , in the council house to murder me and my good lord of gloucester ? 
 there be fools alive , iwis , silvered oer—and so was this . take what wife you will to bed , i will ever be your head . 
 what country , friends , is this ? 
 if he may be conveniently delivered , i would he were , for i am now so far in offense with my niece that i cannot pursue with any safety this sport to the upshot . 
 my own flesh and blood to rebel ! 
full of wise care is this your counsel , madam . take all the swift advantage of the hours .you shall have letters from me to my son in your behalf , to meet you on the way .be not taen tardy by unwise delay .
 why dost thou weep ? canst thou the conscience lack , to think i shall lack friends ? 
 therefore on , or strip your sword stark naked , for meddle you must , that’s certain , or forswear to wear iron about you . 
 she hath not seen the change of fourteen years . let two more summers wither in their pride ere we may think her ripe to be a bride . 
 [to fool] come , help to bear thy master . thou must not stay behind . 
 away , and let me die . 
 thy wit is a very bitter sweeting . it is a most sharp sauce . 
 holds it true , sir , that the duke of cornwall was soslain ? 
 no , marry . i fear thee . 
 now , fellow ,what is there ? 
 alack , my lord , that fault is none of yours . 
 cousin of buckingham , a word with you . 
 i will choose mine heir from forth the beggars of the world , and dispossess her all . 
apollos angry ; and the heavens themselvesdo strike at my injustice . how now there !
 can thy spirit wonder a great man should decline ? nay , an you weep , i am falln indeed . 
 was never mother had so dear a loss . alas , i am the mother of these griefs . 
 how angerly i taught my brow to frown , when inward joy enforced my heart to smile ! 
 and they have been grand -jurymen since before noah was a sailor . 
 —yet , more to move you , take my deserts to his , and join em both : and , for i know your reverend ages love security , ill pawn my victories , all my honours to you , upon his good returns . 
 fie , no , do not believe it ; he cannot want for money . 
 i need not tell him that ; he knows you are too diligent . 
 you call me misbeliever , cutthroat dog , and spet upon my jewish gaberdine— and all for use of that which is mine own . 
 thats not so , sir : we are your enemies . 
 it is a quarrel just and reasonableto be revenged on him that killed my husband . 
 away , i say ! stayst thou to vex me here ? 
 for andrew , if he were opened and you find so much blood in his liver as will clog the foot of a flea , i’ll eat the rest of the anatomy . 
 let us be cleard of being tyrannous , since we so openly proceed in justice , which shall have due course , even to the guilt or the purgation . 
 what say they ? 
 tis indeed , madam ; we thank the giver . 
 his large fortune upon his good and gracious nature hanging subdues and properties to his love and tendance all sorts of hearts ; yea , from the glass -faced flatterer to apemantus , that few things loves better than to abhor himself : 
 and i wish , my liege ,you had only in your silent judgment tried it ,without more overture . 
 and when this arm of mine hath chastisèd the petty rebel , dull -brained buckingham , 
 and you too , sir . 
 these your unusual weeds to each part of you do give a life : 
 that would i learn of you ,as one being best acquainted with her humor . 
 o lady fortune ,stand you auspicious ! 
 i would have men of such constancy put to sea , that their business might be everything and their intent everywhere , for that’s it that always makes a good voyage of nothing . farewell . 
 “informed them ?” dost thou understand me , man ? 
 relenting fool and shallow , changing woman ! 
 hark ! the kings and the princes , our kindred , are going to see the queens picture . come , follow us : well be thy good masters . 
 this is a practise as full of labor as a wise man’s art , for folly that he wisely shows is fit . but wise men , folly -falln , quite taint their wit . 
 give her an hundred marks . ill to the queen . 
 i weigh my friends affection with mine own ; ill tell you true . ill call to you . 
 gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing , more than any man in all venice . 
 but if black scandal or foul -faced reproach attend the sequel of your imposition , your mere enforcement shall acquittance me from all the impure blots and stains thereof , 
 my lord , i would that thursday were tomorrow . 
 then speak the truth by her ; if not divine , 
 but montague is bound as well as i , in penalty alike . 
 it’s dry , sir . 
 he will do all in all as hastings doth . 
 why , we shall make him mad indeed . 
 of that fatal country , sicilia , prithee speak no more ; whose very naming punishes me with the remembrance of that penitent , as thou callest him , and reconciled king , my brother ; whose loss of his most precious queen and children are even now to be afresh lamented . 
 either thou wilt die by god’s just ordinance ere from this war thou turn a conqueror , or i with grief and extreme age shall perish and nevermore behold thy face again . 
 ill go along , no such sight to be shown , but to rejoice in splendor of mine own . 
 the mere want of gold , and the falling -from of his friends , drove him into this melancholy . 
 to both their deaths shalt thou be accessory . 
 o , many have broke their backs with laying manors on em for this great journey . 
 you see me , lord bassanio , where i stand such as i am . 
 a callat of boundless tongue , 
 and thou unfit for any place but hell . 
 why , then , this may be yours , for this is but one . 
 go waken juliet . go and trim her up . ill go and chat with paris . 
 what should i see then ? 
 black and portentous must this humor prove unless good counsel may the cause remove . 
 well held out , i faith . 
 here were the servants of your adversary , and yours , close fighting ere i did approach . i drew to part them . 
 what , has his daughters brought him to this pass ?—couldst thou save nothing ? wouldst thou give em all ? 
 welcome , ass . now let’s have a catch . 
 and so doth mine . i muse why she’s at liberty . 
how now , rustics ! whither are you bound ?
 but for all this thou shalt have as many dolors for thydaughters as thou canst tell in a year . 
 why , what’s the matter ? does he rave ? 
 ay , sir . 
 now will he be swinged for reading my letter ; anunmannerly slave , that will thrust himself intosecrets ! ill after , to rejoice in the boys correction . 
 and hither make , as great ambassadors from foreign princes . 
 you were best say these robes are not gentlemen born : give me the lie , do , and try whether i am not now a gentleman born . 
 no , by my life . privy to none of this . 
 longer than i prove loyal to your gracelet me not live to look upon your grace . 
 you say you do not know the lady’s mind . uneven is the course . i like it not . 
 affection ! thy intention stabs the centre : thou dost make possible things not so held , communicatest with dreams ;—how can this be ?— 
 ay , he . 
 why , fare thee well :here is some gold for thee . 
 i am my masters true -confirmed love ; but cannot be true servant to my master , unless i prove false traitor to myself . 
 from whose simplicity i think it not uneasy to get the cause of my sons resort thither . 
 dieu vous garde , monsieur . 
 a mellifluous voice , as i am true knight . 
 do not extort thy reasons from this clause , for that i woo , thou therefore hast no cause , 
 and here he stands . i dare be sworn for him he would not leave it nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth that the world masters . 
 for whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith into a thousand oaths ; and all those oaths descended into perjury , to love me . 
 next , if i fail of the right casket , never in my life to woo a maid in way of marriage ; 
 vouchsafe me , for my meed , but one fair look ; 
 the more fool , madonna , to mourn for your brother’s soul being in heaven . take away the fool , gentlemen . 
 knows he the wickedness ? 
 by’r lady , thirty years . 
 then , good my lord , take to your royal self this proffered benefit of dignity , if not to bless us and the land withal , yet to draw forth your noble ancestry from the corruption of abusing times unto a lineal , true -derivèd course . 
how is ’t , my lord ? how look you ?
 ay , so true love should do : 
put this in any liquid thing youwilland drink it off ; and , if you had the strengthof twenty men , it would dispatch you straight .
come , good sir . will you show me to this house ?
 why , jessica ! 
 rebellious subjects , enemies to peace , profaners of this neighbor -stainèd steel !— 
 a gentleman , nurse , that loves to hear himself talk , and will speak more in a minute than he will stand to ina month . 
 ay , but this answer will not serve . 
 ill believe him as an enemy , and give over my trade . 
 a friend ? what friend ? your name , i pray you , friend ? 
 do you note how much her grace is alterd on the sudden ? 
 under yon yew trees lay thee all along , holding thine ear close to the hollow ground— so shall no foot upon the churchyard tread , being loose , unfirm , with digging up of graves , but thou shalt hear it . 
 i feel my heart new opend . o , how wretched is that poor man that hangs on princes favours ! 
 my noble father , henry of buckingham , who first raised head against usurping richard , flying for succor to his servant banister , being distressd , was by that wretch betrayd , and without trial fell ; gods peace be with him ! 
 fortunate mistress ,—let my prophecy come home to ye !— 
 thou art not altogether a fool . 
 now , my fairst friend , i would i had some flowers o the spring that might become your time of day ; and yours , and yours , that wear upon your virgin branches yet your maidenheads growing : 
 the two kings , equal in lustre , were now best , now worst , as presence did present them ; him in eye , still him in praise : and , being present both twas said they saw but one ; and no discerner durst wag his tongue in censure . 
 o tybalt , tybalt , the best friend i had !o courteous tybalt ! honest gentleman !that ever i should live to see thee dead . 
 i shall answer that better to the commonwealth than youcan the getting up of the negro’s belly . the moor is with child by you , launcelot . 
 sir thomas lovell and lord marquess dorset , tis said , my liege , in yorkshire are in arms . but this good comfort bring i to your highness : 
 o my antonio , had i but the means to hold a rival place with one of them , i have a mind presages me such thrift that i should questionless be fortunate ! 
 good day , sir . 
 there is a sicknesswhich puts some of us in distemper , buti cannot name the disease ; and it is caughtof you that yet are well . 
 not so , sir , i do care for something . but in my conscience , sir , i do not care for you . 
 nor i neither . 
 though ’twere to buy a world of happy days , so full of dismal terror was the time . 
 but since thou lovest , love still and thrive therein , even as i would when i to love begin . 
 but i will write again to mantua , and keep her at my cell till romeo come . poor living corpse , closed in a dead mans tomb ! 
 call you ? what is your will ? 
 good counsel , marry . —learn it , learn it , marquess . 
 why not , my lord ? if then they chanced to slack you , we could control them . if you will come to me— for now i spy a danger— 
 and this my neighbour too ? 
 all the land knows that :however , yet there is no great breach ; when it comes ,cranmer will find a friend will not shrink from him . 
 why , this bond is forfeit ! 
 bliss be upon you ! tell me , good my friend , what torch is yond that vainly lends his light to grubs and eyeless skulls ? 
 that suffers under probation . “a” should follow but “o” does . 
 “m .o .a .i . doth sway my life .” nay , but first , let me see , let me see , let me see . 
 whither ? 
 i think tis no unwelcome news to you . 
 thou wast provokèd by thy bloody mind , that never dream’st on aught but butcheries .didst thou not kill this king ? 
 an thou let part so , sir andrew , would thou mightst never draw sword again . 
 seal up the mouth of outrage for a while , till we can clear these ambiguities 
 so do i , my lord .they are entirely welcome . 
 nay , but say true , does it work upon him ? 
 if she dares trust me with her little babe , ill showt the king and undertake to be her advocate to the loudst . 
 his regiment lies half a mile , at least , south from the mighty power of the king . 
good my lord , soothe him . let him takethe fellow .
 and then i offered her mine own , who is a dog as big as ten of yours , 
 tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to your lover . 
 well , sir , my mistress is the sweetest lady .—lord , lord ! when ’twas a little prating thing .—oh , there is a nobleman in town , one paris , that would fain lay knife aboard , 
 some sixteen months , and longer might have stayd ,if crooked fortune had not thwarted me . 
 at the queens bet : good should be pertinent but , so it is , it is not . 
 go you , malvolio . if it be a suit from the count , i am sick , or not at home . 
come hither , herald .—let the trumpet sound ,—and read out this .
 and might not be delivered to the world , till i had made mine own occasion mellow , what my estate is . 
 myself myself confound , heaven and fortune bar me happy hours , day , yield me not thy light , nor night thy rest , 
 he started one poor heart of mine in thee . 
 now , by my maidenhead at twelve year oldi bade her come . what , lamb ! what , ladybird !god forbid ! where’s this girl ? what , juliet ! 
 what kind o man is he ? 
 i prithee , peace . my soul is full of sorrow . 
 ready , so please your grace . 
 i am dumb . 
 with all my heart . 
 my most dear gloucester ! 
 nay , he’s a flower . in faith , a very flower . 
 as far as i see , all the good our english have got by the late voyage is but merely a fit or two o the face ; but they are shrewd ones ; 
 and if on earth he do not merit it , in reason he should never come to heaven . 
 lastly , if i do fail in fortune of my choice , immediately to leave you and be gone . 
 at last , with easy roads , he came to leicester , lodged in the abbey ; where the reverend abbot , with all his covent , honourably received him ; to whom he gave these words , 
 no more than i am well acquitted of . 
 by holy paul , they love his grace but lightly that fill his ears with such dissentious rumors . 
 cancel his bond of life , dear god i pray , that i may live to say , “the dog is dead .” 
 here is a friar , and slaughtered romeo’s man ,with instruments upon them fit to open these dead men’s tombs . 
 telling them i know my place as i would they should do theirs , to ask for my kinsman toby— 
pray , sir , put your sword up , if you please .
 noble lady , first mine own service to your grace ; the next , the kings request that i would visit you ; 
 my lord , the mayor of london comes to greet you . 
 call her divine . 
 joy had the like conception in our eyesand at that instant like a babe sprung up . 
 for then this land was famously enriched with politic grave counsel ; then the king had virtuous uncles to protect his grace . 
 if that the youth will come this way tomorrow , i’ll give him reasons for ’t . hie thee , malvolio . 
 one that comes before to signify th approaching of his lord , 
 things done well , and with a care , exempt themselves from fear ; things done without example , in their issue are to be feard . have you a precedent of this commission ? 
twere false , if i should speak it ;for i am sure she is not buried .
 god grant that some , less noble and less loyal , nearer in bloody thoughts , and not in blood , 
 then , good my lords , bear witness to his oath . 
 what do you mean ? 
 nay , pursue him now , lest the device take air and taint . 
 here is a friar that trembles , sighs and weeps .we took this mattock and this spade from him as he was coming from this churchyard’s side . 
 hell stay my lord . 
be of good cheer , mother . how fares your grace ?
 stay , yet look back with me unto the tower .— 
 from all dishonesty he can : in this ,unless he take the course that you have done ,commit me for committing honour , trust it ,he shall not rule me . 
 pretty too .—what say you , james soundpost ? 
 come , come , nerissa , for i long to see quick cupid’s post that comes so mannerly . 
 (to maria ) where’s malvolio ? he is sad and civil and suits well for a servant with my fortunes . where is malvolio ? 
 stay not , be gone . live , and hereafter say a madman’s mercy bid thee run away . 
 avoid the gallery . 
 god bless thee , lady ! 
 fetch drier logs .call peter . he will show thee where they are . 
 know thou this : that men are as the time is . to be tender -minded does not become a sword . 
 but smothered it within my panting bulk , who almost burst to belch it in the sea . 
 age , thou hast lost thy labour . 
 pardon him , sweet timandra ; for his wits are drownd and lost in his calamities . 
 the quality of mercy is not strained . it droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath . 
 windy attorneys to their clients woes , airy succeeders of intestate joys , poor breathing orators of miseries , 
 shut doors after you . fast bind , fast find . a proverb never stale in thrifty mind . 
 i have no exquisite reason for ’t , but i have reason good enough . 
 descend , and keep your words . 
 he hath known you butthree days , and already you are no stranger . 
 no question . 
 how and which way i may bestow myself to be regarded in her sun -bright eye . 
fathom and half , fathom and half ! poor tom !
 sir , speed you . what’s your will ? 
 villain am i none . therefore , farewell . i see thou know’st me not . 
 now blessed be the great apollo ! 
 and you must cut this flesh from off his breast .the law allows it , and the court awards it . 
 yet he , of all the rest , i think , best loves ye . 
 most thankfully , my lord . 
 tis noble kent , your friend . 
 that i was fain to draw mine honour in , and let em win the work : the devil was amongst em , i think , surely . 
 the senators with one consent of love entreat thee back to athens ; 
 your friends are well and have them much commended . 
 nay , but you will ? 
 i may not , madam :to the contrary i have express commandment . 
 thou art proud , apemantus . 
 adieu , my lord ; sir valentine is coming . 
 thou whoreson zed , thou unnecessary letter !—my lord , ifyou will give me leave , i will tread this unbolted villain into mortar and daub the wall of a jakes with him .—spare my gray beard , you wagtail ? 
 o , thats the case of the shepherds son : hang him ,hell be made an example . 
 i have so : what of him ? 
 i will have nothing else but only this .and now methinks i have a mind to it . 
 mark , how strange it shows , timon in this should pay more than he owes : 
 and one in whom the ancient roman honor more appears than any that draws breath in italy . 
 nay , good sir toby . 
 if the matter of this paper be certain , you have mightybusiness in hand . 
 in such a night did jessica steal from the wealthy jew ,and with an unthrift love did run from veniceas far as belmont . 
 if it be you that stir these daughters hearts against their father , fool me not so much to bear it tamely . touch me with noble anger . 
 go , you cot -quean , go .get you to bed , faith . you’ll be sick tomorrowfor this night’s watching . 
 and will ignoble make you , yea , scandalous to the world . 
 good proteus , go with me to my chamber , in these affairs to aid me with thy counsel . 
 right . 
my lord , entreat him by no means to stay .
 ill show you how to observe a strange event .your lord sends now for money . 
 knows he of this ? 
 he’s dead . i am only sorry he had no other death’s -man . let us see . [takes letters out of oswald’s pocket and opens them] 
 therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh . shed thou no blood , nor cut thou less nor more but just a pound of flesh . 
so wise so young , they say , do never live long .
the lord increase this business !
 and speak of frays like a fine bragging youth , and tell quaint lies , how honorable ladies sought my love , which i denying , they fell sick and died— i could not do withal !— 
ask him his purposes , why he appearsupon this call o th trumpet .
 nay , good my lord , be not afraid of shadows . 
 well , let that rest . dorset is fled to richmond . 
 no money , on my faith , but the gleek . i will give you the minstrel . 
 for it is you have blown this coal betwixt my lord and me ; which gods dew quench ! therefore i say again , i utterly abhor , yea , from my soul refuse you for my judge ; 
 what fashion , madam shall i make your breeches ? 
 with leave , bassanio , i am half yourself , and i must freely have the half of anything that this same paper brings you . 
 so many miseries have crazed my voicethat my woe -wearied tongue is still and mute .edward plantagenet , why art thou dead ? 
 whats the cause ? 
 lower messes perchance are to this business purblind ? say . 
 sir proteus , as i take it . 
 why should she write to edmund ? might not you transport her purposes by word ? 
 ay , ay . i care not for good life . 
 my lords , you speak your pleasures : what he deserves of you and me i know ; what we can do to him , though now the time gives way to us , i much fear . 
 now i’ll tell you without asking . my master is the great rich capulet , and if you be not of the house of montagues , i pray come and crush a cup of wine . rest youmerry ! 
 cousins , indeed , and by their uncle cozened of comfort , kingdom , kindred , freedom , life . 
 nay , either tell me where thou hast been , or i will notopen my lips so wide as a bristle may enter in way of thy excuse . 
 come , sir , what letters had you late from france ? 
 i cannot draw a cart , nor eat dried oats . if it be man’s work , i’ll do ’t . 
 rescue , my lord of norfolk , rescue , rescue ! the king enacts more wonders than a man , daring an opposite to every danger . 
 no , we’ll reason with him . 
 i’ll go , my lord , and tell him what you say . 
 sweet lady , ho , ho . 
 yes , faith , my lord . 
 first , it was usual with him , every day it would infect his speech , that if the king should without issue die , hell carry it so to make the sceptre his : 
 farewell , and take her ; but direct thy feet where thou and i henceforth may never meet . 
 go , hie thee , hie thee from this slaughterhouse , lest thou increase the number of the dead 
 well , we will leave you then till dinnertime . 
 come on . in this there can be no dismay .my ships come home a month before the day . 
 romeo will answer it . 
 upon this warrant shall you have access where you with silvia may confer at large ; for she is lumpish , heavy , melancholy , and , for your friends sake , will be glad of you ; 
 no ; i eat not lords . 
 o our lives sweetness , that we the pain of death would hourly die rather than die at once !— 
 but in the cutting it if thou dost shed one drop of christian blood , thy lands and goods are by the laws of venice confiscate unto the state of venice . 
 hath not my gait in it the measure of the court ? receives not thy nose court -odor from me ? 
 she says it is a fair one . 
 why , so i do , the noblest that i have . 
 my lord archbishop ;and has done half an hour , to know your pleasures . 
 and all the ceremony of this compact sealed in my function , by my testimony , 
 peter ! 
 but that thy brothers beat aside the point . 
 if she do frown , tis not in hate of you , but rather to beget more love in you : if she do chide , tis not to have you gone ; for why , the fools are mad , if left alone . 
 so farewell to the little good you bear me . farewell ! a long farewell , to all my greatness ! this is the state of man : to -day he puts forth the tender leaves of hopes ; 
 a crutch , a crutch ! why call you for a sword ? 
 o , thou didst prophesy the time would come that i should wish for thee to help me cursethat bottled spider , that foul bunch -backed toad ! 
 a gracious king that pardons all offences malice neer meant : 
 stop there ; ill have her : she was mine , and not mine , twice or thrice in that last article . 
 but for his purpose in the coronation , i have not sounded him , nor he delivered his gracious pleasure any way therein . 
 yet i have not seen so likely an ambassador of love . 
 jove bless thee , master parson . 
 marry , you may partly hope that your father got you not , that you are not the jew’s daughter . 
 well , let it be .— what ho , malvolio ! 
 come to what is important in ’t . i forgive you the praise . 
 my mind gave me , in seeking tales and informations against this man , whose honesty the devil and his disciples only envy at , 
 well part the time betweens then ; and in thatill no gainsaying . 
 we know each other’s faces ; for our hearts , he knows no more of mine than i of yours , or i of his , my lord , than you of mine .— 
 here in these confines slyly have i lurked to watch the waning of mine enemies . 
 a sad tales best for winter : i have oneof sprites and goblins . 
 for by the way i’ll sort occasion , as index to the story we late talked of , to part the queen’s proud kindred from the prince . 
 tybalt is gone , and romeo banishèd .romeo that killed him—he is banishèd . 
 but at hand , at hand ensues his piteous and unpitied end . 
 no marvel , lord , though it affrighted you . i am afraid , methinks , to hear you tell it . 
 ay , mother , but i would not have it so . 
 they have in england a coin that bears the figure of an angel stamped in gold , but that’s insculped upon . but here an angel in a golden bed lies all within .— 
 a rhyme i learned even nowof one i danced withal . 
 and thereupon he sends you this good news , that this same very day your enemies , the kindred of the queen , must die at pomfret . 
 how dost thou like this tune ? 
 o , but , sir , your resolution cannot hold , when tis opposed , as it must be , by the power of the king : 
 and hate the idle pleasures of these days . plots have i laid , inductions dangerous , by drunken prophecies , libels and dreams , 
 no ;you shall not make me welcome :i come to have thee thrust me out of doors . 
 at your request ! yes , nightingales answer daws ! 
 [to richard] let me sit heavy in thy soul tomorrow , i , that was washed to death with fulsome wine , poor clarence , by thy guile betrayed to death . 
 produce their bodies , be they alive or dead . this judgment of the heavens that makes us trembletouches us not with pity . 
 that is the very defect of the matter , sir . 
 if they have done this deed , my noble lord— 
 be merry , and employ your chiefest thoughts to courtship and such fair ostents of love as shall conveniently become you there .” 
 this letter he early bid me give his father , and threatened me with death , going in the vault , if i departed not and left him there . 
 the dearest ring in venice will i give you , and find it out by proclamation . 
 she shall be , to the happiness of england , an aged princess ; many days shall see her , and yet no day without a deed to crown it . 
 myself could else outfrown false fortune’s frown . shall we not see these daughters and these sisters ? 
 and how do yours ? 
 nod—ay—why , thats noddy . 
 you mistook , sir ; i say , she did nod : and you askme if she did nod ; and i say , ay . 
 he is not the flower of courtesy , but , i’ll warrant him , as gentle as a lamb . go thy ways , wench . serve god . what , have you dined at home ? 
 ( aside ) fie on him , jezebel ! 
 it is twice blessed : it blesseth him that gives and him that takes . 
 it may be so , for it is not mine own .—are you at leisure , holy father , now ,or shall i come to you at evening mass ? 
 my life upon ’t , young though thou art , thine eye hath stay’d upon some favor that it loves . 
 how ? 
 a proclaimed prize ! most happy ! that eyeless head of thine was first framed flesh to raise my fortunes . 
 nothing . 
 what’s this ? what’s this ? 
 speakest thou from thy heart ? 
 i speak too long , but ’tis to peize the time , to eke it and to draw it out in length , to stay you from election . 
 no , believe me . 
 believe me , theres an ill opinion spread theneven of yourself , lord cardinal . 
 you shall see , as i have said , great difference betwixt our bohemia and your sicilia . 
 what means that trump ? 
 and one thing more , that you be never so hardy to come again in his affairs ,unless it be to report your lord’s taking of this . 
 who did guide ,i mean , who set the body and the limbsof this great sport together , as you guess ? 
 my lord , go then ; and with a countenance as clear as friendship wears at feasts , keep with bohemia and with your queen . 
 lorenzo and salerio , welcome hither , if that the youth of my new interest here have power to bid you welcome . 
 and that we have a curse in having her . out on her , hilding ! 
 he shall flourish , and , like a mountain cedar , reach his branches to all the plains about him : our childrens children shall see this , and bless heaven . 
oh , i am slain ! if thou be merciful , open the tomb . lay me with juliet .
 i shall grow jealous of you shortly , launcelot , if you thus get my wife into corners . 
 what were more holy than to rejoice the former queen is well ? what holier than , for royaltys repair , for present comfort and for future good , to bless the bed of majesty again with a sweet fellow tot ? 
 how painted ? and how out of count ? 
 on , good camillo . 
 i’ll wait upon your lordship . 
 ay sir : i , a lost mutton , gave your letter to her , a laced mutton , 
 this is the letter to your ladyship . 
 how now ! are you sadder than you were before ? howdo you , man ? the music likes you not . 
 if you will then see the fruits of the sport , mark his first approach before my lady . 
 o , then unfold the passion of my love , surprise her with discourse of my dear faith : 
 tis ten to one this play can never please all that are here : some come to take their ease , and sleep an act or two ; but those , we fear , we have frighted with our trumpets ; 
 a king , a king ! 
 about it , gentlemen ! 
 a false conclusion . i hate it as an unfilled can . 
 i pray you , sir , what is he ? 
 undone ! undone ! if i might die within this hour , i have lived to die when i desire . 
 call me to your remembrances . 
 the swifter speed the better . 
 why , it hath bay windows transparent as barricadoes , and the clerestories toward the south -north are as lustrous as ebony . 
 what , man , ’tis not so much , ’tis not so much . ‘tis since the nuptials of lucentio , 
 back , foolish tears , back to your native spring . your tributary drops belong to woe , which you , mistaking , offer up to joy . 
 delay this marriage for a month , a week . or , if you do not , make the bridal bed in that dim monument where tybalt lies . 
 whiles i may ’scape , i will preserve myself , and am bethought to take the basest and most poorest shape that ever penury in contempt of man brought near to beast . 
 i should think so : he hath sent me an earnest inviting , which many my near occasions did urge me to put off ; 
 sir , i have upon a high and pleasant hill feignd fortune to be throned : the base o the mount is rankd with all deserts , all kind of natures , that labour on the bosom of this sphere to propagate their states : 
 nothing . 
 disguise , i see thou art a wickedness , wherein the pregnant enemy does much . 
 tis no matter . let it go . there’s few or none will entertain it . 
 you’re welcome hither . 
 you are rapt , sir , in some work , some dedicationto the great lord . 
 oh , when mine eyes did see olivia first , methought she purged the air of pestilence . 
 bind him , i say . 
 this is the penthouse under which lorenzodesired us to make stand . 
 the king shall know it , and , no doubt , shall thank you . so fare you well , my little good lord cardinal . 
 there is no tongue that moves , none , none i the world , so soon as yours could win me : so it should now , were there necessity in your request , although twere needful i denied it . 
 we say that shore’s wife hath a pretty foot , a cherry lip , a bonny eye , a passing pleasing tongue , and that the queen’s kindred are made gentlefolks . 
 you are too senseless obstinate , my lord , too ceremonious and traditional . 
 a gentler judgment vanished from his lips :not body’s death , but body’s banishment . 
 ill hunt with him ; and let them be received ,not without fair reward . 
yea , noise ? then i’ll be brief . o happy dagger ,this is thy sheath . there rust and let me die .
 ay , so i fear . the more is my unrest . 
 there wanteth but a mean to fill your song . 
 the tenor of them doth but signifymy health and happy being at your court . 
 indeed the short and the long is , i serve the jew and have a desire , as my father shall specify— 
 there is nothing done if he return the conqueror . then am i the prisoner and his bed my gaol , from the loathed warmth whereof deliver me , and supply the place for your labor . 
 you have done our pleasures much grace , fair ladies , set a fair fashion on our entertainment , which was not half so beautiful and kind ; 
 what will this come to ? he commands us to provide , and give great gifts , and all out of an empty coffer : nor will he know his purse , or yield me this , to show him what a beggar his heart is , being of no power to make his wishes good : 
 where shall i meet you ? 
 oh , here he is . lay hand upon him .—sir ,your most dear daughter— 
 if thou entertainest my love , let it appear in thy smiling . thy smiles become thee well . 
 so is alcides beaten by his page , and so may i , blind fortune leading me , miss that which one unworthier may attain and die with grieving . 
 though the pennyworth on his side be the worst , yet hold thee , theres some boot . 
 their aunt i am in law , in love their mother .then bring me to their sights . i’ll bear thy blame and take thy office from thee , on my peril . 
 mistress mary , if you prized my lady’s favor at anything more than contempt , you would not give means for this uncivil rule . 
 no doubt , no doubt . o , ’tis a parlous boy ,bold , quick , ingenious , forward , capable . he is all the mother’s , from the top to toe . 
 pray , give me favour , sir . this cunning cardinal the articles o the combination drew as himself pleased ; and they were ratified as he cried thus let be : 
 ill news , by r lady . seldom comes the better . i fear , i fear , ’twill prove a giddy world . 
 wherein my hope is i shall so prevail to force him after : in whose company i shall review sicilia , for whose sight i have a womans longing . 
 well said , hermione . 
 please you sir , the king , your father , was reputed for a prince most prudent , of an excellent and unmatchd wit and judgment : 
 i have within my mind a thousand raw tricks of these bragging jacks which i will practice . 
 wife , go you to her ere you go to bed . acquaint her here of my son paris’ love , and bid her , mark you me , on wednesday next— but , soft ! what day is this ? 
 tomorrow , then , i judge a happy day . 
 but till i come again , no bed shall eer be guilty of my stay , 
 she is ,when once she is my wife . 
 i mean , to go , sir , to enter . 
“odors ,” “pregnant ,” and “vouchsafed .” i’ll getem all three all ready .
 but when his fair course is not hindered , he makes sweet music with the enamelled stones , giving a gentle kiss to every sedge he overtaketh in his pilgrimage , 
 it will help me nothing to plead mine innocence ; for that dye is on me which makes my whitest part black . 
 and after , this : and then to breakfast withwhat appetite you have . 
 but if she cannot love you , sir ? 
 ay , boy , ready . 
 o you mighty gods , [kneels] this world i do renounce , and in your sights shake patiently my great affliction off . 
 there have been , or i am much deceived , cuckolds ere now ; and many a man there is , even at this present , now while i speak this , holds his wife by the arm , that little thinks she has been sluiced ins absence and his pond fishd by his next neighbour , by sir smile , his neighbour : 
 thy garments are not spotted with our blood , nor thou within the compass of my curse . 
 be gone ! i will not hear thy vain excuse ; but , as thou lovest thy life , make speed from hence . 
 sir , do you know me ? 
 ere i was risen from the place that showed my duty kneeling , came there a reeking post , stewed in his haste , half breathless , panting forth from goneril his mistress salutations , 
 ay , you are honest men . 
 whose house ? 
 march , noble lord , into our city with thy banners spread : by decimation , and a tithed death— 
 even so void is your false heart of truth .by heaven , i will neer come in your beduntil i see the ring . 
 welcomed all , served all ; would sing her song and dance her turn ; now here , at upper end o the table , now i the middle ; on his shoulder , and his ; her face o fire with labour and the thing she took to quench it , she would to each one sip . 
 ill draw the curtain :my lords almost so far transported thathell think anon it lives . 
 but she , good soul , had as lief see a toad , a very toad , as see him . i anger her sometimes and tell her that paris is the properer man . 
from both , my lord . bellario greets your grace .
 delivered letters spite of intermission , which presently they read , on whose contents they summoned up their meiny , straight took horse , 
 your grace ? 
 marry and will , my lord , with all my heart . 
 if twill not serve ,tis not so base as you ;for you serve knaves . 
 i am sorry that your leisure serves you not .—antonio , gratify this gentleman ,for in my mind you are much bound to him . 
 fairer than tongue can name thee , let me havesome patient leisure to excuse myself . 
 bear witness , all that have not hearts of iron , with what a sorrow cromwell leaves his lord . the king shall have my service : but my prayers for ever and for ever shall be yours . 
 my most exquisite sir topas ! 
 who removed , earl surrey was sent thither , and in haste too , lest he should help his father . 
 so eating love inhabits in the finest wits of all . 
 a blank , my lord . she never told her love , but let concealment , like a worm i the bud , feed on her damask cheek . 
 therefore out of thy long -experienced time , give me some present counsel , or , behold , ‘twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife shall play the umpire , arbitrating that which the commission of thy years and art could to no issue of true honor bring . 
 not in love neither ? then let us say you are sad because you are not merry— and ’twere as easy for you to laugh and leap and say you are merry because you are not sad . 
 tut , tut , my lord , we will not stand to prate .talkers are no good doers . be assured we go to use our hands and not our tongues . 
 tis known before . our preparation stands in expectation of them . o dear father , it is thy business that i go about . 
 th unsatiate greediness of his desire and his enforcement of the city wives ; 
 caitiff , to pieces shake , that under covert and convenient seeming hast practiced on man’s life . 
 send to her , by the man that slew her brothers , a pair of bleeding hearts ; thereon engrave “edward” and “york .” then haply she will weep . 
 when jacob grazed his uncle laban’s sheep— this jacob from our holy abram was , 
 he is wise ,and , on my life , hath stol’n him home to bed . 
 sir valentine and servant , to you two thousand . 
you live that shall cry woe for this hereafter .
 but tell me , dost thou know my lady silvia ? 
 ay , millstones , as he lessoned us to weep . 
 and grew a twenty -years -removed thing while one would wink , denied me mine own purse , which i had recommended to his use not half an hour before . 
 faith , i’ll home tomorrow , sir toby . your niece will not be seen . 
 for what offence ? 
 o sweet paulina ,make me to think so twenty years together !no settled senses of the world can matchthe pleasure of that madness . lett alone . 
 it is much that the moor should be more than reason . but if she be less than an honest woman , she is indeed more than i took her for . 
 which of you—if you were a princes son being pent from liberty , as i am now— if two such murderers as yourselves came to you , would you not entreat for life ? 
 pour on , i will endure . in such a night as this ! o regan , goneril , your old kind father , whose frank heart gave all— 
 thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair . 
 why , this is the worlds soul ; and just of the same piece is every flatterers spirit . 
 i have taught him , even as one would say precisely , thus i would teach a dog . i was sent to deliver him as a present to mistress silvia from my master ; and i came no sooner into the dining -chamber but he steps me to her trencher and steals her capons leg : 
 there is no other way ,unless thou couldst put on some other shape and not be richard , that hath done all this . 
why , how now , my bawcock ! how dost thou , chuck ?
 no . 
 but though i am a daughter to his blood , i am not to his manners . 
 stared each on other and looked deadly pale ; which when i saw , i reprehended them and asked the mayor what meant this willful silence . 
 i feel too much thy blessing . make it less , for fear i surfeit . 
 and that , since then , you have not dared to break the holy seal nor read the secrets int . 
 this is the indictment of the good lord hastings , which in a set hand fairly is engrossed , that it may be today read oer in paul’s . 
 go on before ; i shall inquire you forth : 
 faith , some certain dregs of conscience are yet within me . 
 you he bade attend him here this morning . 
 oh , what a goodly outside falsehood hath ! 
 go to , go to . you are a saucy boy . is ’t so , indeed ? this trick may chance to scathe you , i know what . you must contrary me . marry , ’tis time .— 
 blistered be thy tongue for such a wish ! he was not born to shame . upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit , for ’tis a throne where honor may be crowned . 
 business , my lord ! i think most understandbohemia stays here longer . 
 consort ? what , dost thou make us minstrels ? an thou make minstrels of us , look to hear nothing but discords .here’s my fiddlestick . here’s that shall make you dance . zounds , “consort” ! 
 i thank you , sir . 
 be assured you may . 
 why , this it is ; see , see ! i have been begging sixteen years in court , am yet a courtier beggarly , nor could come pat betwixt too early and too late for any suit of pounds ; 
 that instant was i turned into a hart , and my desires , like fell and cruel hounds , eer since pursue me . 
 and therefore haste away , for we must measure twenty miles today . 
 to -morrow blossoms , and bears his blushing honours thick upon him ; the third day comes a frost , a killing frost , 
 i do not know what kind of my obedience i should tender ; more than my all is nothing : nor my prayers are not words duly hallowd , 
 why dost thou seek me out ? 
 when the sun sets the air doth drizzle dew , but for the sunset of my brother’s son it rains downright . 
 talk not to me , for i’ll not speak a word .do as thou wilt , for i have done with thee . 
 the lady bade take away the fool . therefore , i say again , take her away . 
 whither art going ? 
 yet that dare less appear so in comforting your evils , than such as most seem yours : 
 out upon her ! thou torturest me , tubal . it was my turquoise . i had it of leah when i was a bachelor . i would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys . 
 well fare you , gentleman : give me your hand ;we must needs dine together . sir , your jewelhath sufferd under praise . 
 sir , the year growing ancient , not yet on summers death , nor on the birth of trembling winter , 
 yonder comes a poet and a painter : the plague of company light upon thee ! 
 so is theirs and ours . 
 with my masters ship ? why , it is at sea . 
 let me stay at thine apperil , timon : i come toobserve ; i give thee warning ont . 
 no , sooth , sir . my determinate voyage is mere extravagancy . but i perceive in you so excellent a touchof modesty that you will not extort from me what i am willing to keep in . 
 thou know’st that all my fortunes are at sea . neither have i money nor commodity to raise a present sum . 
 tell out my blood . 
 o , heaven be judge how i love valentine , whose lifes as tender to me as my soul ! 
 there will be the beauty of this kingdom , ill assure you . 
 that thou hast wrongèd in the time oerpast ; for i myself have many tears to wash hereafter time , for time past wronged by thee . 
 what thinkst thou of the gentle proteus ? 
 what , gone without a word ? 
 how chance the prophet could not at that timehave told me , i being by , that i should kill him ? 
 and so adieu , good madam . nevermore will i my master’s tears to you deplore . 
 ay , if you thought your love not cast away . 
 diana’s lip is not more smooth and rubious . thy small pipe is as the maiden’s organ , shrill and sound , and all is semblative a woman’s part . 
 for whose dear love , they say , she hath abjured the company and sight of men . 
 how likes she my discourse ? 
 good morrow to you both . what counterfeit did i give you ? 
 they love me well ; yet i have much to do to keep them from uncivil outrages . 
 thou know’st the mask of night is on my face , else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek for that which thou hast heard me speak tonight . 
 thou art going to lord timons feast ? 
 i cannot tell if to depart in silence or bitterly to speak in your reproof best fitteth my degree or your condition . 
 is this the promised end ? 
 if i revolt , off goes young george’s head ; the fear of that holds off my present aid . 
 the more degenerate and base art thou , to make such means for her as thou hast done and leave her on such slight conditions . 
 even or odd , of all days in the year , come lammas eve at night shall she be fourteen . susan and she—god rest all christian souls !— were of an age . 
 we are but plain fellows , sir . 
 i tell thee , my master is become a hot lover . 
 most certain , sir . 
 go in , and tell my lady i am gone , having displeased my father , to lawrence’s cell to make confession and to be absolved . 
 yes , surely . 
 nor do i now make moan to be abridged from such a noble rate . 
 i will withdraw , but this intrusion shall now seeming sweet , convert to bitterest gall . 
 say she shall be a high and mighty queen . 
hover about her ; say that right for righthath dimmed your infant morn to agèd night .
 wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile . filths savor but themselves . what have you done ? tigers , not daughters , what have you performed ? 
 but then speak the truth— do you not love my sister ? 
 who is it ? 
 you may say it , but not swear it . 
 this is signor antonio . 
 and i , that am sure i lack thee , may pass for a wise man . for what says quinapalus ? 
 one , lady , if you knew his pure hearts truth ,you would quickly learn to know him by his voice . 
 but tell me , wench , how will the world repute me for undertaking so unstaid a journey ? i fear me , it will make me scandalized . 
but to be commandedfor ever by your grace , whose hand has raised me .
 i have already . 
 harp not on that string , madam ; that is past . 
 whats the matter ? why weepest thou , man ? away , ass ! youll lose the tide , if you tarry any longer . 
 these are the youths that thunder at a playhouse , and fight for bitten apples ; that no audience , but the tribulation of tower -hill , or the limbs of limehouse , their dear brothers , are able to endure . 
 well , sir , the poor distressèd lear’s i th town , who sometime in his better tune remembers what we are come about , 
 and is it thus ? repays he my deep service with such deep contempt ? made i him king for this ? 
 sir proteus , your father calls for you :he is in haste ; therefore , i pray you to go . 
 the rudeness that hath appeared in me have i learned from my entertainment . 
 a beast , as thou art . the canker gnaw thy heart ,for showing me again the eyes of man ! 
 i pray thee , chide not . her i love nowdoth grace for grace and love for love allow .the other did not so . 
 well , the best is , she hath no teeth to bite . 
 fool , do not flatter . my conscience hath a thousand several tongues , and every tongue brings in a several tale , and every tale condemns me for a villain . 
 and , till my soul forsake , shall cry for blessings on him : may he live longer than i have time to tell his years ! 
 that time serves still . 
 [to edmund ] general , take thou my soldiers , prisoners , patrimony . dispose of them , of me . the walls is thine . 
 but did’st thou see them dead ? 
 but if mine , then yours , and so all yours . oh , these naughty times put bars between the owners and their rights ! 
 oh , she says nothing , sir , but weeps and weeps , and now falls on her bed , and then starts up , 
 most wonderful ! 
 give him a present .give him a halter . i am famished in his service . you may tell every finger i have with my ribs . father , i am glad you are come . 
 heaven will one day open the kings eyes , that so long have slept upon this bold bad man . 
 good fool , for my brother’s death . 
 all these owe their estates unto him . 
 where was his son when they did take his eyes ? 
 a pretty one ; a very pretty one : sure , some scape : though i am not bookish , yet i can read waiting -gentlewoman in the scape . 
 why , this is excellent . 
 whiles in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts , which here we waken to our country’s good , 
 i think , by this he is . 
 all mens ! 
 to verona . 
 friendships full of dregs : methinks , false hearts should never have sound legs , thus honest fools lay out their wealth on courtsies . 
 i do remember an apothecary— and hereabouts he dwells—which late i noted in tattered weeds , with overwhelming brows , culling of simples . 
 anon comes one with light to ope the tomb , and by and by my master drew on him , and then i ran away to call the watch . 
 ah , he is young , and his minorityis put unto the trust of richard gloucester ,a man that loves not me nor none of you . 
 who told me , in the field by tewkesbury , when oxford had me down , he rescued me , and said “dear brother , live , and be a king ?” 
 hath romeo slain himself ? say thou but “ay ,” and that bare vowel i shall poison more than the death -darting eye of cockatrice . 
 you’re servant to the count orsino , youth . 
 her chamber is aloft , far from the ground ,and built so shelving that one cannot climb itwithout apparent hazard of his life . 
 sit you down , father . rest you . let’s see these pockets . the letters that he speaks of may be my friends . 
 a prize , a prize , a prize ! 
 madam , there is at the gate a young gentleman much desires to speak with you . 
 no , ’tis not so deep as a well nor so wide as a church -door , but ’tis enough , ’twill serve . ask for me tomorrow , and you shall find me a grave man . 
 never—o fault !—revealed myself unto him until some half -hour past , when i was armed . 
 no , no . but all this did i know before .what says he of our marriage ? what of that ? 
 men that hazard all do it in hope of fair advantages . a golden mind stoops not to shows of dross . i’ll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead . 
 over the boots ? nay , give me not the boots . 
 ( aside ) that youth’s a rare courtier . “rain odors .” well . 
 and will she yet abase her eyes on me , that cropped the golden prime of this sweet prince and made her widow to a woeful bed ? 
 most true , if ever truth were pregnant by circumstance : that which you hear youll swear you see , there is such unity in the proofs . 
 o that ever i was born ! 
 she returns this ring to you , sir . you might have savedme my pains to have taken it away yourself . 
 let me read them . 
 most welcome , sir ! 
 but i’ll be hanged , sir , if he wear your livery .marry , go before to field , he’ll be your follower .your worship in that sense may call him “man .” 
 but , alas the while ! if hercules and lychas play at dice which is the better man , the greater throw may turn by fortune from the weaker hand . 
 what , angry , sir turio ! do you change colour ? 
 ass , i doubt not . 
 i have a jewel here— 
 or i will drag thee on a hurdle thither . out , you green sickness , carrion ! out , you baggage ! you tallow face ! 
 why , uncle , ’tis a shame . 
 if you will not murder me for my love , let me be your servant . 
 even such and so in favor was my brother , and he went still in this fashion , color , ornament , for him i imitate . 
 twere as good a deed as to drink when a man’s a -hungry , 
 if not , that i am queen , you bow like subjects , yet that , by you deposed , you quake like rebels .— 
 get thee gone , but do it . 
 sir turio , give us leave , i pray , awhile ;we have some secrets to confer about . 
 here in the streets , desperate of shame and state , in private brabble did we apprehend him . 
 here’s my son , sir , a poor boy— 
 why , how now , kinsman ? wherefore storm you so ? 
 blasting in the bud , losing his verdure even in the prime and all the fair effects of future hopes . 
 we are the queen’s abjects and must obey .— brother , farewell . 
 let her hang me . he that is well hanged in this world needs to fear no colors . 
 anon ! 
 beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself , 
 i am not mad , sir topas . i say to you this house is dark . 
 and your store , i think , is not for idle markets , sir . 
 for your great graces heapd upon me , poor undeserver , i can nothing render but allegiant thanks , my prayers to heaven for you , my loyalty , 
 beshrew me but i love her heartily . 
 well , sir , for want of other idleness , i’ll bide your proof . 
 and then to have the humor of state , and after a demuretravel of regard , 
 myself and my good cousin buckingham will to your mother , to entreat of her to meet you at the tower and welcome you . 
 and range with humble livers in content , than to be perkd up in a glistering grief , and wear a golden sorrow . 
 for there was never yet fair woman but she made mouths in a glass . 
 pretty .—what say you , hugh rebeck ? 
 a hall , a hall , give room !—and foot it , girls .— 
 must it be so ? it must not be . my lords ,i do beseech you , know me . 
 nine changes of the watery star hath been the shepherds note since we have left our throne without a burthen : 
 howling attends it . how hast thou the heart , being a divine , a ghostly confessor , a sin -absolver , and my friend professed , to mangle me with that word “banishèd” ? 
 sir , my lord the duke of buckingham , and earl of hereford , stafford , and northampton , 
 if i hope well , ill never see thee more . 
 o , then my best blood turn to an infected jelly and my name be yoked with his that did betray the best ! 
 if you had known the virtue of the ring , or half her worthiness that gave the ring , or your own honor to contain the ring , you would not then have parted with the ring . 
 ladies ! what are their wills ? 
 i am debating of my present store , and by the near guess of my memory 
 and private in his chamber pens himself , shuts up his windows , locks fair daylight out , and makes himself an artificial night . 
 he hath disgraced me and hindered me half a million , laughed at my losses , mocked at my gains , scorned my nation , thwarted my bargains , cooled my friends , heated mine enemies—and what’s his reason ? 
 heavens peace be with him ! thats christian care enough : for living murmurers theres places of rebuke . he was a fool ; 
 you are to blame ,knowing she will not lose her wonted greatness ,to use so rude behavior ; go to , kneel . 
 fairly answerd ; a loyal and obedient subject is therein illustrated : the honour of it does pay the act of it ; 
 could my good brother suffer you to do it— a man , a prince by him so benefited ? 
 he is a kinsman to the montague . affection makes him false . he speaks not true . 
 good morrow , kind sir eglamour . 
 and so i pray you tell him . 
 but she did scorn a present that i sent her . 
 i will unto the king , and whatsoeer you will employ me in , were it to call king edward’s widow “sister ,” i will perform it to enfranchise you . 
 o you gods , think i , what need we have any friends , if we should neer have need of em ? they were the most needless creatures living , should we neer have use for em , and would most resemble sweet instruments hung up in cases that keep their sounds to themselves . 
 no ,tis to thyself . 
 and , not to swell our spirit , he shall be executed presently . 
 well , come again tomorrow . fare thee well .a fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell . 
but better , indeed , when you hold your peace .
 tis all engaged , some forfeited and gone ; and what remains will hardly stop the mouth of present dues : 
 he is within , with two right reverend fathers , divinely bent to meditation , and in no worldly suits would he be moved to draw him from his holy exercise . 
 why grow the branches when the root is gone ? why wither not the leaves that want their sap ? 
 who calls so loud ? 
 if that be to care for nothing , sir , i would it would make you invisible . 
 and thou , good goddess nature , which hast made it so like to him that got it , if thou hast the ordering of the mind too , mongst all colours no yellow int , lest she suspect , as he does , her children not her husbands ! 
 lo , ere i can repeat this curse again , within so small a time my woman’s heart grossly grew captive to his honey words and proved the subject of mine own soul’s curse , 
 have you the tongues ? 
 what became of his bark and his followers ? 
 my lord , your promise for the earldom— 
 there is no lady living so meet for this great errand . 
 that i can tell you too . the archbishop of canterbury , accompanied with other learned and reverend fathers of his order , held a late court at dunstable , six miles off from ampthill where the princess lay ; 
 any thing , my lord ,that my ability may undergoand nobleness impose : at least thus much :ill pawn the little blood which i have leftto save the innocent : any thing possible . 
 did my heart love till now ? forswear it , sight ! for i ne’er saw true beauty till this night . 
 but , tell me , where is princely richmond now ? 
 always a villains office or a fools .dost please thyself int ? 
 a grave ? oh , no . a lantern , slaughtered youth , for here lies juliet , and her beauty makes this vault a feasting presence full of light . death , lie thou there , by a dead man interred . 
 most excellent accomplished lady , the heavens rain odors on you ! 
 o , that our fathers would applaud our loves , to seal our happiness with their consents ! o heavenly julia ! 
 for first was he contract to lady lucy— your mother lives a witness to that vow— and afterward by substitute betrothed to bona , sister to the king of france . 
 that , at her hands , which the king’s king forbids . 
 and hath he too exposed this paragon to the fearful usage , at least ungentle , of the dreadful neptune , to greet a man not worth her pains , much less the adventure of her person ? 
 is not the causer of the timeless deaths of these plantagenets , henry and edward , as blameful as the executioner ? 
 but that slander , sir , is found a truth now : for it grows again fresher than eer it was ; and held for certain the king will venture at it . 
 and to confine yourself to asher house , my lord of winchesters , till you hear further from his highness . 
welcome , dear cousin , my thoughts sovereign .the weary way hath made you melancholy .
 how dost , fool ? 
 save thee , timon . 
 i pray thee , out witht , and place it for her chief virtue . 
 well , do you so , let not me take him then .for if i do i’ll mar the young clerk’s pen . 
 which if i have not enough considered , as too much i cannot , to be more thankful to thee shall be my study , and my profit therein the heaping friendships . 
 and give the letters which thou find’st about me to edmund , earl of gloucester . seek him out upon the british party . o untimely death ! [ dies] 
 my verywalk should be a jig . i would not so much as make waterbut in a sink -a -pace . 
 those that can pity , here may , if they think it well , let fall a tear ; the subject will deserve it . 
 o me ! this sight of death is as a bell ,that warns my old age to a sepulcher . 
 ant please your honour , we are but men ; 
 thou stickest a dagger in me . i shall never see my goldagain . fourscore ducats at a sitting ! fourscore ducats ! 
come , away !
 i have spoke long : be pleased yourself to sayhow far you satisfied me . 
 i cannot find it . tis not in the bond . 
 but o , the noble combat that twixt joy and sorrow was fought in paulina ! she had one eye declined for the loss of her husband , another elevated that the oracle was fulfilled : 
 i know not what i shall think of that . but i am launcelot , the jew’s man , and i am sure margery your wife is my mother . 
 it is so . 
 no remedy .have you done there ? 
 well , but what’s oclock ? 
 i do profess you speak not like yourself ; who ever yet have stood to charity , and displayd the effects of disposition gentle , and of wisdom oertopping womans power . 
 then i repent not . 
 welcome , my lord . i dance attendance here .i think the duke will not be spoke withal . 
 farewell , and if my fortune be not crost , i have a father , you a daughter , lost . 
 but we have been deceived in thy integrity , deceived in that which seems so . 
 good or bad news , that thou com’st in so bluntly ? 
 is she not proud ? doth she not count her blessed , unworthy as she is , that we have wrought so worthy a gentleman to be her bride ? 
look , where he stands and glares !—want’st thou eyes at trial , madam ? come oer the bourn , bessy , to me—
 be better suited .these weeds are memories of those worser hours .i prithee , put them off . 
 i do the wrong , and first begin to brawl . the secret mischiefs that i set abroach i lay unto the grievous charge of others . 
 yet thus far we are one in fortunes : both fell by our servants , by those men we loved most ; a most unnatural and faithless service ! 
 i , that am rudely stamped and want love’s majesty to strut before a wanton ambling nymph ; 
 i do come with words as medicinal as true , honest as either , to purge him of that humour that presses him from sleep . 
 no , to whitefriars . there attend my coming . 
 you must take your chance , and either not attempt to choose at all 
 he should , for that , commit your godfathers . 
 i will seem friendly , as thou hast advised me . 
 then let them anatomize regan . see what breeds about her heart . is there any cause in nature that makes thesehard hearts ? 
 how silver -sweet sound lovers’ tongues by night , like softest music to attending ears ! 
 from whom he bringeth sensible regreets , to wit—besides commends and courteous breath— gifts of rich value . 
 if spirits can assume both form and suit you come to fright us . 
 gentlewoman , my lady calls . 
 alive in triumph—and mercutio slain ! away to heaven , respective lenity , and fire -eyed fury be my conduct now . 
 humbly i thank your lordship : never maythe state or fortune fall into my keeping ,which is not owed to you ! 
 what man is there so much unreasonable , if you had pleased to have defended it with any terms of zeal , wanted the modesty to urge the thing held as a ceremony ? 
 were ’t my fitness to let these hands obey my blood , they are apt enough to dislocate and tear thy flesh and bones . 
 thou wilt amend thy life ? 
 bid him bring his power before sunrising , lest his son george fall into the blind cave of eternal night . 
 put up your sword . if this young gentleman have done offence , i take the fault on me . 
 swear by your double self , and there’s an oath of credit ! 
 it shall advantage thee more than ever the bearing of letter did . 
 at pembroke , or at harfordwest in wales . 
 stanley , look to your wife . if she conveyletters to richmond , you shall answer it . 
 you have your wish ; my will is even this : that presently you hie you home to bed . thou subtle , perjured , false , disloyal man ! 
 i’ll answer that . 
 “fair sir , you spet on me on wednesday last ; you spurned me such a day ; another time you called me ’dog—and for these courtesies i’ll lend you thus much moneys ?” 
 which even but now , demanding after you , denied me to come in—return , and force their scanted courtesy . 
 but let him swear so , and he shall not stay , well thwack him hence with distaffs . 
 what wouldst do then , apemantus ? 
 which reformation must be sudden too , my noble lords ; for those that tame wild horses pace em not in their hands to make em gentle , but stop their mouths with stubborn bits , and spur em , till they obey the manage . 
 bade me enjoy it , with the place and honours , during my life ; and , to confirm his goodness , tied it by letters -patents : now , wholl take it ? 
 to mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle , he prettily and aptly taunts himself . 
 thou calledst me dog before thou hadst a cause . but since i am a dog , beware my fangs . 
 therefore i keep it lonely , apart . but here it is : prepare to see the life as lively mockd as ever still sleep mockd death : 
 once more , take her hence . 
 a fair assembly . whither should they come ? 
 ay , so he says . 
 the trick of that voice i do well remember .is ’t not the king ? 
 if thou refuse and wilt encounter with my wrath , say so ; the bastard brains with these my proper hands shall i dash out . 
 how tall was she ? 
 stay , madam . i must talk a word with you . 
 he that dares approach , on him—on you , who not ?—i will maintain my truth and honor firmly . 
 after all this , how did he bear himself ? 
 and , may i say to thee , this pride of hers , upon advice , hath drawn my love from her ; 
 then rose again and bowd her to the people : when by the archbishop of canterbury she had all the royal makings of a queen ; as holy oil , 
 this night—wherein the cub -drawn bear would couch , the lion and the belly -pinchèd wolf keep their fur dry—unbonneted he runs , and bids what will take all . 
 they are reformed , civil , full of good and fit for great employment , worthy lord . 
 wherein he might the king his lord advertise whether our daughter were legitimate , respecting this our marriage with the dowager , sometimes our brothers wife . 
 t rue , sir ; i was in love with my bed : 
 you will not own it . 
 maria writ the letter at sir toby’s great importance , in recompense whereof he hath married her . 
 rain sacrificial whisperings in his ear , make sacred even his stirrup , and through him drink the free air . 
 theres time enough for that ; lest they desire upon this push to trouble your joys with like relation . go together , you precious winners all ; your exultation partake to every one . 
god bless the prince from all the pack of you ! a knot you are of damnèd bloodsuckers .
 why , what a monstrous fellow art thou , thus to rail on one that is neither known of thee nor knows thee ! 
 farewell . 
 what must be shall be . 
 when the oracle , thus by apollos great divine seald up , shall the contents discover , something rare even then will rush to knowledge . 
 lend me the letter ; let me see what news . 
 how , my pretty york ? i prithee let me hear it . 
 not nature , to whom all sores lay siege , can bear great fortune , but by contempt of nature . 
 if i do not , never trust me , take it how you will . 
 for still we prove much in our vows , but little in our love . 
 thou speak’st it well .—go , father , with thy son .— 
 he has ; and we shall see himfor it an archbishop . 
 by cruel , cruel thee quite overthrown ! o love ! o life ! not life , but love in death . 
 for my writ is on the life of lear and on cordelia . nay , send in time ! 
what should this mean ?
 sir , i have brought my lord the archbishop ,as you commanded me . 
 kept him a foreign man still ; which so grieved him , that he ran mad and died . 
 they fell on ; i made good my place : at length they came to the broom -staff to me ; i defied em still : when suddenly a file of boys behind em , loose shot , delivered such a shower of pebbles , 
 let me alone . 
and lessened be that small , god i beseech him !thy honor , state , and seat is due to me .
 have we marched on without impediment , thus far into the bowels of the land 
 i know your lady does not love her husband . i am sure of that . 
 . i’ll serve this duke . thou shall present me as an eunuch to him . 
 since i am crept in favor with myself , i will maintain it with some little cost . 
 a glooming peace this morning with it brings . the sun for sorrow will not show his head . 
 how do you now ? 
 contending with the fretful elements . bids the winds blow the earth into the sea or swell the curlèd water bove the main , that things might change or cease . 
 no , madam . we have culled such necessaries as are behooveful for our state tomorrow . so please you , let me now be left alone , 
 even so .—cover their faces . 
 things have fall’n out , sir , so unluckily , that we have had no time to move our daughter . 
 the pretence whereof being by circumstances partly laid open , thou , hermione , contrary to the faith and allegiance of a true subject , didst counsel and aid them , for their better safety , to fly away by night .
