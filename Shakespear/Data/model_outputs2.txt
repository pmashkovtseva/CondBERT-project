my dear romeo , poor romeo ! he is already dead , stabbed with a white horseman ’ s left - front right - hand , shooting through the ears with a love song ,
a special reason is given : for then she need not be washedand scoured .
a man , they say , that from very nothing , and beyond the imagination of his neighbours , is grown into an unspeakable , evil man .
true or false , it is i who made you earl of gloucester . seek out where your lord father is , that he may be ready for our long awaited journey .
what says that fool of hagar ’ s offspring , then ? ?
behind the tall needles of pines i met them ; neversaw i men would do so on their way : i looked out the window to their ships .
and so so could i too .
i would you were set , so your affection would end .
enough ; i read your fortune in your eyes . was this the idol that you worship so ?
when the mind ’ s free , the body ’ s delicate . the vortex in my mind that leaks from my senses take all feeling else save what beats there — filial ingratitude .

and , with my best endeavours in your absence , your great - great father hope to qualified and bring him up to his greatness .
no , madam ; so it pleases you , i will writeplease you command , a thousand times as much ; and still —
you have seen sunshine and rain at once — her smiles and tears were like a better way .
do you hear , sir ?
i hope he does it soon , but his friends will turn to us .
put your main cause into the kings protection ; hes loving and most gracious : there will always be much both for your honor better and your cause ;
sure , you have some hideous matter to deliver , when thecourtesy of it is so fearful . speak your own mind .
tomorrow , then , we will meet , your grace , and so long and so joyfully we take our leave .
and so still think of the wrong i did myself ; which was so much , that heirless it is that i made my kingdom and destroyd the only true companion that the old - man raised his hopes out of .
but he has somehow somehow brought me beyond them , and i must needs appear .
welcome , dear proteus ! mistress , i must remind you , i accept his welcome with some special favor .
here ’ s a good world the while . who is so a good world that can see this damning little machine ?
orsino . i have heard my father name him . he was a knight back then .
. . ... .
mistress , look out at window , for all this .
the weight of margaret ’ s curse falls heavy on my neck : “ when he , ” he , says she , “ will split your broken heart with sorrow , remember that her mother was a prophecy . ” —
so will you feel the lost , but not the friendwhich you weep for .
i will not rise unless your highness hear me .
well , peace be with you , sir . here comes my man .
the sun not yet shining , the sighs from heaven cleared , and the great old groans ring yet in my ancient ears . oh lord , here on my inner cheek the stain can still sit of an old tear that is not washed off my own face .
i had only been three months married to her , sitting in my house alone —
now he goes with no less presence but with much more love than young troy had , when he did it to pay the virgin . he was paid by howling troy to the sea god .

my back a ’ t ’ other side . ah , my back , my back ! be your heart for sending me about , to catch my death with jaunting up and down !
ah , for our father , for our dear lord and holy father !
i will return again into the house and help you with some more tests of the lady .
if i want you to talk a little wild , forgive me ; i had it from my father .
her natural stance !
but then , sir , sometimes he is a kind of puritan .
remember our reward when the good work it ’ s done .
i make no sound , i say .
of gloucester ’ s faithfulness , and of the loyal service of his son , when i informed him , then he called me “ sot , ” and told me i had turned the wrong side out .
let them have an open mind , though what they will do can help nothing else , but only then do they come to the heart .
oh my god , what a terrible sin is it in me to be ashamed to be my father ’ s child !
it is the white , upturned , wondering eyes of mortals that fall back to gaze on him when he walks through the lazy - puffing clouds and sails on the coolness of the air .
what , by a horseman , or a footman ?
the slip , sir , the slip . can you be able to do that ?
how cheerest i am , jessica ? and now , good sweet , say your humble opinion . how wouldest i be ? like the lord bassanio ’ s wife ?
o , no , he loves me , and he holds me dear . go you to him from me .
and i , equal parts god , righteous and all things else , could speak you out , the queen of earthly queens :
if i had you in lipsbury pinfold , i would make you swear you care for me .
approach , sir andrew . not to be up here after midnight is to be up all night , and diluculos is , as you know ’ he was , —
but , sir , sir , hear me , sir thomas : youre a gentleman of truth in your own way ; i know you wise , religious ;
sweetly in force to her will until her life ’ s end .
marry , my lord , that if pierced by a multitude the new - healed wound of my own neck should break out , which would be so much the more dangerous by how much the estate is green and so far ungoverned .
had you not been their father , these white flakes did challenge pity of them . was this a face to be against against the warring winds ?
therefore , be prepared for all feasts , society , and the feasting of men ! his semblable , highly intelligent son , himself , timon , shouted : destruction fang mankind ! earth , give to me roots !
good your god , god , let me have time and advice for my cause : oh , i am a woman , friendless , hopeless !
you will not then ?
is she not passing the time ?
theres fresher air , my lord , in the next chambers .

brave peasant , bold peasant , dare i ever support a published traitor ?
a satire against the softness of prosperity , with a more detailed description of the infinite evils that follow youth and opulency .
would it please you , sir , be gone ? i told you what would come of this : i beg you , of your own state take care : this dream of a dead man , — being now awake , ill queen it no inch to do so , but milk my ewes and weep .
' no , my lord , that should not be : you are a noblewoman , and , by that virtue , no man dare accuse you .
that can never be . his ring i do accept , very much so .
as she lived a long way , so her dead body has , i do well believe , excels whatever yet you look on or hand of man you have never done ;
happy were england would this virtuous prince take on his grave the property of the church .
prove true , imagination , oh , prove true , that i , dear brother , be now a matchmaker for you !
stay , my lord , and let your reason with your body . never question what the hell do you go about : to climb up these rocky hills requires slow , cautious steps at first :
you are welcome . take your place . are you aware with the differencethat is this an important question in the court ?
or " how nature slept . —
but how came i so blessed by this ring ? at my time gave this necklace to julia .
and i need your advice this night ill put in my favor . therefore , sweet proteus , my direction - giver , let us into the city in order to find ourselves with some gentlemen well skilld in music .
i will , my lord .
but for me , fellow . fellow , your words are so true : three months this youth has ever tended on me ; but more of that can be done .
and soam i to you .
you see , pilgrim , lips that they must use in prayer .
for me ? must i go like a traitor to them ?
is this well spoken now ?
what was to be done about his sentence , was rather , if there be true goodness , in men , meant for his trial , and there be greater evils to the world , than evil , im sure , in me .
but he , poor man , by your first order died , and that a man like mercury did the same thing .
so are you , sweet , even in the lovely garnish of a boy .
to do this deeds , promotion follows .
" how can they see us ?
under what title do i woo for my love , that god , the law , my honor and her love can make seem pleasing to her for many long years ?
glancing an almost look of pity on his losses that have of late so huddled on his back it was impossible to let such a royal merchant down and make no judgements of his state from brassy headstones and rough hearts of stone , from stubborn soldiers , and tartars never trained to officials of any royal or royal rank .
what you will , to dismiss it .
so the were bleeding - new , my lord , theres no meatlike on your plate : i could wish my best friend at such a feast .
your grace , i would say , with dancing is a little heated .
oh my god , read i have the damn right brains .
two families , both alike in dignity in a city like verona , where we have turned our scene , from ancient grudge break to new insurrection , where civil blood makes civil hands unclean .
oh yes , good tr .
well - a - day that you were , sir .
i see this is the time that the unjust man does not survive . what an exchange had this been without boot ! what a boot is here with this exchange !
before the days of change , still is it so . by a divine instinct , men ’ s minds sensed the presence of deadly dangers ,
i wonder that such a keech can with his very own power can take up the rays o the beneficial sun and keep it from the earth .
i have come for you , my lord .
' oh yes , my lord ; even soas it is here to break you down .
so .
do you think , my lords , the king will suffer but the little fingerof this man to be put to death ?
you have a servant named lucilius .
those eyes of those farthest from her would probably have drawn salt tears , shame their eyes , with a whole lot of childish them .
that , by killing of villains , i myself am born to conquer my country .
and why do they choose death rather than living torment ? to die is to be ban from myself ; and silvia is myself : ban from her is self from self : a deadly ban !
o , gods will ! much better she would have had known the words : thought be singular ,
a little scrubbed boy no higher than his father , the judge ’ s clerk , a pretty little boy that begged it as a fee .
he knows the truth to what he says , and he knows to it that we have given us to him .
for that he alone should suffer what wit can make heavy and retribution bitter ; but those that are germane to him , though taken fifty times , should all come under the hanging :
why , so i know all this , both by the father and mother .
my husband lives , that tybalt would have murdered , and tybalt ’ s dead , that would have murdered my husband . all this is comfort . why do i weep i then ?
for he would needs be virtuous : that good fellow , if i command him , follows my appointment :
i do not speak , and neither think , neither do dare to know that which i know .
you look like a strange young man . a tailor make a man ?
my lord , sir ; i am angry with him ; who now has these poor men in question .
she is too good for me , too wise , if not too over - confident , to achieve that much of myself by making me despair .
, as , i confess , there is no truth attached to his corrections ,
he is a stone , a very pebble stone , and has no more pity in him than a dog : a jew would have wept to have seen our parting ; why , my own mother , having no eyes , look you , wept herself blind at my parting .
what a caterwauling do you keep here !
[ to the secretary ] let there be letters of apology sent to every shire , of the kings ' forgiveness , and pardon . the grieved king could hardly speak better of me ;
so do you , but take it : take it for your labourers .
so what is his name ?
after my death i wish no other historian , no other speaker of my living actions , to keep my work free from corrupt , but such an honest historian as griffith .
well , we will then know more ; and buckinghamshall lessen this big look .
sir paris , i will make a sure and true and honest declaration of my child ’ s love . i think she will be ruled in all respects by me . ah , more , i doubts it to be true . —
with another , fortying his new shoes with old ribbons ? and yet i want you to tutor me from all sides !
may it please your lord father , —
i could not personally deliver to her what you commanded me , but by her woman i sent your message ;
good time of day for you , my gracious lord .
where is gentle rivers , vaughan , gray ?
where the devil should this romeo be ? came he ' d be home tonight ?
" your lips rot off !
i know of no , i do not know i you by voice or any feature .
we have always truly served you , and we thank you so to all those of us , and on our knees we beg , as a reminder of our dear services past and to come , that you do change this moment for us ,
sir , your gloves .
the same last name , but one of better nature .
i dare be sworn these dangerous roads of lunes i the king , be them !
to make an act of tragic violence . my lord , my lord , your beloved son , our king , is dead .
i , madam ?
a thousand times good night !
i put up my guard watch . leave me . ratcliffe , about the mid of night come to my tentand help to get back at me . leave me , i say .
fool , fool , fool , i say !
he is in heaven , where he knows you will surely never come .
towards cher , noble lord ?
oh , ’ that would actually be very nice !
give us the place alone . we will hear this god .
if our betters play at that game , we must not dare to imitate them ; faults that are rich are never so rich .
two women placed together makes cold weather : my lord , my lord , you are one will keep me from my waking ; my lord god , sit between these ladies .
this trusty servant must never pass between us . so how long you are like to hear — if you dare venture in your own behalf — a mistress ’ s command .
o upright judge ! — a good judge , jew . — o learned judge !
o , this is full of pity ! sir , it calls , i ' d say , too many curses on their headsthat were the authors .
what , are they broken ?
am i like such a fellow ?
she is damned for it .
but , god be thanked , there is no need of me , and much i need to help you , were there need .
i would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever knapped her hair or made her neighbors believe she wept for the death of a third husband .
have not alone employing you where high profits might come home , but pared my present havings , to bestow my bounties on you .
my prayers on the side of the party fight , and there the little souls of the king arthur ’ s children whisper the spirits of our greatest enemies and promise them success and victory .
for his particular i ’ ll have to pay him gladly , but not one follower .
noble , noble lord ! well ; i am not of that feather to shake off my friend when he must need me .
and so will i .
here , madam , at your service .
o joy , i am made away ! i ' t can be born ! my eyes cannot hold out water , i cry : to forget their faults , i drink to you .
but if you please to shoot another arrow that self way which you did shoot the first , i do not doubt , as i will watch the aiming , or to find both or bring your both of these arrows back again and thankfully rest debt for the first .
hastings and king richard iii ’ s children , grey and rivers , holy king henry and his own children , their son and heir william , vaughan , and all that have been murdered by underhand , corrupted , or cruel injustice ,
one being dead , i do not have more than you can dream of far ;
a bloody filthy white gown , a long and slender white linen shirt . pale , pale as ashes , all bedaubed in blood , all in his own blood . i shuddered violently at the sight .
but oh , how love can do nothing with itself ! here is her beautiful face : let me see ; i think , if i had such a pretty face , this face of yours , it were full as lovely as is this of hers : and but the painters only love her a little , unless i flat with myself too much .
how with a man of honor , can i give him that i have given to you ?
what was your dream , my lord ? i can hear you tell me .
one would think his mother ’ smilk were too far out of him .
a pound of man ’ s flesh taken from a man is not so much desirable , or desirable as neither , as flesh of muttons , beefs , or goats .
the clock struck nine when i did send the nurse . in half an hour she promised to return . even if she promised not to meet him . that ’ s not so .
and ask no other dowry with her but such another one with me .
in celebration of this day with shows , pageants and other displays of honor .
it is so wonderful , when angels are so angry .
o , swear not by the moon , but by my ’ inconstant moon , that monthly changes in her circle will be irregular , and swear again that your true love prove nothing but irregular .
o valentine , this i endure for all eternity !
why , “ some are born great , some achieve greatness , and some have greatness thrown on them . ” i was one , sir , in this interlude , one sir topas , sir , but that ’ s all one .
that is , although , my good lord cardinal , they have thrown their reproaches and complaints so bitterly on you , as putter on of these exactions , that they make the king our master —
and , sure , those men are happy that will have me . the last is , for my men ; they are the poorest , but poverty could never draw money away from me ;

sir eglamour , i would to valentine , to mantua , where i hear he makes great friends ; and , for the ways are dangerous to pass , i do desire your worthy company , on whose loyalty , and honor i will depend .
this feather is yours . she lives . if it be so , it is a chance which does bring me to all sorrowsthat ever i have felt .
my lord ?
come to me , give back , or else embrace your death ; come not within the very last hour of my wrath ; do not name silvia as your mother ; if once again , verona will not hold you forever .
tomorrow , sir . best first go see your hotel .
but i know that i have made you no tall fellow of your hands and that you ought to never be drunk :
take the boy to you : he so troubles me , his sad past enduring .
i am going back to going out to breakfast , jessica . there are my keys . —
that some great traitor this day had plotted , in the council house to kill me and my good lord of gloucester ?

his large fortune on his good and gracious nature hanging subdues and properties to his love and tendance all sorts of hearts ; it is said , from the cold , stone - faced flat to apemantus , that few things loves better than to do so to himself :
and i wish , my lord , you had only in your silent judgment tried it , without more overture .
and when this arm of an old man had gently chastised the much - younger rebel , it had hot - bloodedly insulted buckingham ,

but from ten to one this play can never please all that are here : some come to take their time with us , and sleep an act or two ; but those , we worry , we have fright with our trumpets ;
a king , a king !
about it , gentlemen !
a false conclusion . i hate it as an unfilled can .
i must tell you , sir , what is he ?
i am gone ! i have gone ! if i might die within this hour , i have lived to die when i desire .
call me to your memories .
the swifter , the faster the better .

delay this marriage for a month , a week . or , if you do it right now , make the bridal bed in that dim , dark corner where tybalt lies .

i should think so : he never once sent me an expression so very inviting , which many my long - ago times did urge me to put off ;
sir , i have on a high and pleasant hill a fortune to be throned : the land , o the mount is rankd with all kinds of animals , all kind of intelligent beings , that work on the outer walls of this circle to propagate their rights :
nothing .
disguise , i see in your expression , is a wickedness , where the pregnant enemy does much .
' it is no matter . let it go . there ’ s few or no ones who will entertain it .
you ’ re welcome here anytime .
you are very much interested , sir , in some work , some dedicationto the great lord .

we say that shore ’ s wife has a pretty foot , a cherry lip , a beautiful blue eye , a fine and very pleasing tongue , and that the queen ’ s courtiers are made gentlefolks .
you are too arrogant and obstinate , my lord , too highly polished , and traditional .
a long - awaited judgment slowly emerged from his lips : not body ’ s death , but body ’ s death and resurrection .
ill hunt with him ; and let them be received , not without a great reward .
you , noise ? then i ’ ll be brief . o happy dagger , this is my sword sheath . there rust and let me die .
i am scared , so i afraid . the more is my unrest .
there is nothing but a mean to fill your song .
the tone of them is sad , but there is good health and happy being at your court .
indeed the short and the long is , i serve the jew and have a desire , as my father does not specify —
there is nothing done if he return the conqueror . then am i the prisoner and his bed my gaol , from the warmth , the warmth you deliver me , and it will be the place for your labor .
you have done our entertainment with too much . and you , my good ladies , have put on a good and good show on our entertainment , which was not half so beautiful and kind ;
what will this come to ? he commands us to provide , and give great gifts , and all out of an empty and empty heart : but how will he know his purse , or offer me this , to show him what a beg his heart is , being of no power to make his wishes good :
where do i meet you ?
oh , here he is . she laid a hand out towards him . — sir , your very very dear daughter —
if you do not entertainest my love , let it appear in your smiling . let your smiles become yours as well .
so is he badly beaten by his page , and so are they . i , blind fortune leading me , miss that that one unworthier may achieve and die with grieving .
though the wounds inflicted on his side be the worst , yet hold me , theres some boot .
their aunt i am in law , in love their mother . then bring me to their eyes . i ’ ll bear your blame and take your wife away from me , on my evil side .
mistress mary , if you prized my lady ’ s favor at anything more than contempt , you would not give good reason for this uncivil rule .
no doubt , no doubt . o , ’ ! he is a parlous boy , bold , quick , well - liked , forward , capable . he is all the mother ’ s , from the top to toe .
pray , give me favor , sir . this cunning cardinal the articles o the combination drew as himself pleased ; and they were ratification as he cried . let be :
ill news , by r lady . seldom comes the better . i worry , i worry , ’ ts prove a giddy world .
but what my hope is i do not so much wish to force him after : in whose company i will review sicilia , for whose sight i have a womans longing .
well said , hermione .
please you sir , the king , your father , was , as for a prince , much more prudent , of an excellent and unmatchd intellect , and judgment :
i have now brought into my mind a thousand raw tricks of these old old jacks which i will practice .
wife , go you to her room before you go to bed . i tell her here of my son paris ’ love , and i will meet her , i will call you me , on wednesday next — but , what a day ! what day is this ?
a happy day , then , i judge a happy day .
but until i come again , no bed will allow me to be guilty of my stay ,
she is , when once she is my wife .
i mean , to go , sir , to enter .
“ odors , ” “ pregnant , ” and “ vouchsafed . ” i ’ l getem all three all ready .
but when his good course is to be ever hindered , he makes sweet music with the enamelled stones , giving a gentle kiss to every sedge he overtaketh in his pilgrimage ,
it will help me nothing to plead my innocence ; for that , a curse is on me which makes my whitest part white .
and , and after , this : and then to breakfast withwhat appetite you have .
but what if she does not love you , sir ?
" hey there , boy , ready .
o you great gods , [ kneels ] this world i do wish you peace , and in your presence i shake me my great sword and ride off .
there have been , or i am much deceived , cuckolds me now ; and many a man there is , even at this very same time , now while i speak this , holds his wife by the arm , that little thinks she has been sluiced out in his absence and his pond fishd by his next neighbor , by sir smile , his neighbor :
your filthy clothing are not spotted with our blood , but be careful to keep you within the circle of my curse .
be gone ! i will not hear your pathetic little excuse ; but , as the lord god loves your life , make speed from your own words .
sir , do you know me ?
then when i was risen from the place that showed my duty kneeling , came there a reeking post , half panting in his hurry , half breathless , panting to keep himself from goneril his mistress to her bed ,
" ah yes , you are honest men .
who owns the house ?
march , noble lord , into our city with your banners spread : by decimation , and a tithed death —
even so empty is your false heart of truth . by heaven , i will beg you , come in your beduntil i see the ring .
welcomed all , served all ; would sing her song and dance her turn ; now here , at upper end o the table , now i the middle ; on his shoulder , and his ; her face o fire with it , and the thing she took to drink it , she would to each one sip .
ill draw the curtain : my lords almost so far away thathell thinkt it lives .
but she , good soul , had as little opportunity to see a toad , a very toad , as see him . i anger her sometimes and tell her that paris is the properer man .
from both , my lord . bellario greets your mother with respect .
delivered letters spite of their differences , which now they read , on whose contents they summoned up their angers , when they first took horse ,
your grace ?
i love him and will , my lord , with all my heart .
if men do not serve , i am not so well - off as you ; for you serve me perfectly .
i am sorry that your hospitality still serves you so well . — antonio , do not disturb this gentleman , for in my mind you are much bound to him .
if nothing better than tongue can name you , let me havesome patient . i need to excuse myself .
all that you see , all that have not hearts of iron , with what a sorrow cromwell leaves his lord . the king do not have my service : but my prayers for ever and for ever will forever be yours .
my most lovely sir topas !
who he was , earl surrey was sent out immediately , and in disgrace , too , asked if he should help his father .
so eating love is in the finest instincts of all .
a blank , my lord . she never told her love , but let concealment , like a worm i the bud , grow up on her left - cheek cheek .
therefore out of your long - experienced time , give me some present advice , or , if necessary , ‘ let go of my extremes and me this bloody knife will play the referee , arbitrating that which the last two years of your years and your life could to no issues of true honor bring .
not in love neither ? then let us say you are sad because you are not merry — and ’ if it is as easy for you to laugh and leap and say you are happy because you are not sad .
' ah , your majesty , my lord , we will not stand to hear this . talkers are no good for you . be sure where we go to use our hands and not our own ears .
i have never known before . our holy family always stands in the way ahead of them . o dear father , it is my holy business that i go about .
for the unsatiate greediness of his own citizens , and his enforcement of the city wives ;
it seems , to pieces shake , that under - allusions and convenient puns never can be properly practiced on man ’ s life .
send to her , by the man that has made her brothers , a pair of bleeding hearts ; there engrave “ both new ” and “ york . ” then and then she will weep .
when the rabbi had grazed his uncle laban ’ s sheep — this letter , from our holy abram was ,
he is wise , and , on my life , i sc ’ n him home to bed .
sir , knight , and servant , to you two thousand .
you live that will cry and cry for this here .
but tell me , wouldest you never know my lady silvia ?
they shook us , millstones , as he lessoned us to weeping .
and grew a twenty - years - old . thing while one would never guess , denied me access to my own purse , which i had recommended to his use only a half an hour before .
" well , i ’ ll home tomorrow , sir toby . your niece will be nowhere to be seen .
for what he was doing ?
o sweet paulina , make me to think so twenty years together ! no settled senses of the world can matchthe sheer intensity . . . of that obsession . lett alone .
it is much that the true love should be more than reason . but if she be less than an honest woman , she is indeed more than i took her for .
which of you — if you were a kings son being driven away from the holy land , as i am now — if two such murderers as yourselves came to you , would you not send them away for life ?
pour on , i will endure . in such a night as this ! o regan , goneril , your old kind father , whose frank heart gave all —
i desirest me to stop in my story against the hair .
why , this is the worlds soul ; and just of the same piece is every flat spirit .
i have taught him , even as one would say precisely , as surely as i would teach a dog . i was sent to deliver him as a good boy , to mistress silvia from my master ; and i came no sooner into the dining - room , but he steps me to her bedroom , and steals her capons leg :
there is no other way , unless you could put on some other shape and not be richard , that i have done all this .
why , how now , my dear girl ! howt do you know , my dear boy ?
no .
but even though i am a daughter to his blood , i am not to his manners .
they looked each on other and looked deadly pale ; that when i saw , i reprehended them and asked the mayor what meant this willful silence .
i feel too much your blessing . make it less , for now . so i say nothing .
and that , since then , you have not dared to break the holy seal or even read the secrets of the world .

if i revolt , off goes young george ’ s head ; the afraid of that holds off my will for their assistance .
the more kind , and the better , that is , to do so , to make such means for her as god himself had always done and leave her on such ill - fitting conditions .
even or odd , of all days in the year , come lammas eve at night do she be fourteen . susan and she — god rest all christian souls ! — were of an age .

that is almost certain , sir .
go in , and tell my lady i am gone , having displeased my father , to lawrence ’ s room , to make confession and to be absolved .

sir proteus , your father calls for you : he is in hurry ; he is ill , i must tell you to go .
the rudeness that has never appeared in me have i learned from my entertainment .
a beast , as you see it . the can gnaw out my heart , for showing me again the eyes of man !

i do remember an apothecary — and hereabouts he resided — which late i had seen , in the green of the trees , with overwhelming eyebrows , culling of simples .
and there i comes one with me , and to go to the tomb , and by and by my master drew on him , and then i ran away to call the watch .
ah , he is young , and his minorityis put him under the trust of richard gloucester , a man that loves not me , but all of you .
who told me , in the fields by the river thames , when oxford had me down , he rescued me , and said “ dear brother , live , and be a king ? ”

men that risk all do it in hope of achieving the same advantages . a golden mind who knows best not to shows of dross . i ’ ll then neither give no risk i take for lead .
over the boots ? ' ' oh , give me not the boots .
( aside ) that youth ’ s a much better court . “ rain odors . ” well .
and will she do nothing but abase her eyes on me , that i had broken the golden prime of this sweet prince and made her widow to a more comfortable comfortable bed ?
what is ever true , if ever truth were pregnant by fate : that which you hear youll swear you see , there is such unity in the proofs .

here in the streets , all out of shame and on the streets , in private brabble did we have to kill him .
here ’ s my son , sir , a poor boy —
why , how now , what is it ? why do i storm you so ?
blasting in the bud , losing his verdure even in the prime and all the positive side - consequences of future hopes .

nine changes of the watery star that has always been the shepherds to us , since we have left our throne without a proper ceremony :
howling is it . how hast i allowed the heart , being a divine , a sins - a sinner , a sin - absolver , and my friend , my father , to mangle me with that word “ banished ” ?
sir , my lord the duke of buckingham , and earl of hereford , stafford , and northampton ,
if i hope well , ill never see me any more .

you are to blame , knowing she will not lose her power , her greatness , to use so rude behavior ; go to , kneel .
fairly answer ; a loyal and obedient subject is there illustrated : the honor of it does pay the act of it ;
could my good brother suffer you to do it — a man , a prince by him so benefited ?
he is a son to the king of england . love makes him false . he speaks not true .
good , good sir , kind sir eglamour .
and so i pray you tell him .
but she did come back with a new one that i sent her .
i will bring you before the king , and whatsoeer you will employ me in , were it to call king james ii ’ s widow “ sister , ” i will perform it to bring them to you .
o you gods , think i , what need we have any friends , if we should ? would we have need of these things ? they were the most common of all creatures living , should we ? we would have use for these sounds , and would more resemble sweet instruments hung up in cases that keep their sounds to themselves .
no , i will listen to your advice .
and , not to swell our spirit , he will be executed soon .
well , come again tomorrow . i wish for you well . a man just like your father might have just sold my soul to hell .
but better , indeed , when you can keep your peace .
we are all engaged , some for and gone ; and what remain will hardly stop the mouth of the dues :
he is the only one , with two rightly named holy fathers , divinely bent to meditation , and in no worldly suits would he be moved to draw him from his holy exercises .
why grow the branches when the root is gone ? why wither to the leaves that want their sap ?
who had been talking so loud ?
if that be to care for nothing , sir , i would it would make you invisible .

oh my lord , my lord ! i can repeat this curse again , within so small a time my woman ’ s heart . . . " i grew captive to his honey words and proved the subject of my own soul ’ s curse ,

what became of his bark and his followers ?
my lord , your promise for the earldom —
there is no lady living so meet for this great and noble woman .
that i can tell you too . the archbishop of canterbury , accompanied with other learned and prominent church fathers of his order , held a late court at southwell abbey , six miles off from ampthill where the royal chapel once now stood ;
any thing , my lord , that my ability may undergoand i must do it : at least that is much : ill pawn the little blood which i have leftto save the innocent : any thing possible .
did my heart love until now ? for it , sight ! for i never ' ’ ve even saw true beauty until this night .
if so , tell me , where is prince william right about now ?
always a villains , men , or a fools . do i please me , your majesty ?
a grave ? oh , no . a lantern , slaughtered youth , for here lies the virgin mary , and her beauty makes this vault a feasting presence full of light . death , lie , lie . . . there , by a dead man buried .
what an excellent accomplished lady , the heavens rain odors on you !

for first was he already married to lady elizabeth , — your mother lives a witnesses to that vow — and he was then by substitute marriage married to lady mary beaufort , sister to the king of france .
that , at her hands , which the king ’ s king forbid .
and why had he too exposed this little girl , to the fearful use , at least ungentle , of the god of neptune , to greet a man who was nothing worth her attention to , much less the adventures of her person ?
is he even the causer of the long - forgotten deaths of these plantagenets , henry and sir francis drake , as blameful as the executions ?
but that slander , sir , is found a truth now : for it grows again fresher than ever when it was ; and held for certain the king will venture at it .
and to confine yourself to asher house , my lord of winchesters , until you hear further from his highness .
welcome , dear cousin , my thoughts are troubled . the weary way your voice sounds made you melancholy .
how am i , fool ?
save me , she begged herself .
i pray you , out witht , and place it for her as a virtue .
well , do you so , let him have me take him then . for if i do i ’ ll do it in the young clerk ’ s front door .
which if i have not enough considered , as too much i cannot , to be more thankful to me . it ought to be my studies , and my profit there the heaping friendships .
and give the letters which i can find ’ what is known about me to edmund , earl of gloucester . do not send him out on the british party . o god of his death ! [ dies ]
my verywalk should be a good thing . i would not so much as make waterbut in a wash - a - step .
those that can pity , here may , if they think it well , let them shed it a tear ; the subject will deserve it .
o me ! this sight of death is as a bell , that warns my old age to a sepulcher .
" if it please your honor , we are but men ;
if you stickest a dagger in me . i swear you will never see my goldagain . four ducats at a sitting ! four ducats !
go away , away !
i have spoken long : be pleased yourself to sayhow far you satisfied me .
i cannot find it . i am not in the bond .
but o , the noble combat that brings me joy and sorrow was fought in paulina ! she had one eyes declined for the lost of her husband , another elevated that the oracle was fulfilled :
i know you will know what i ought to think of that . but i am launcelot , the jew ’ s man , and i am sure margery your wife is my mother .
it is so .
no cure . have you done there ?
well , but what ’ s oclock ?
i do believe that you speak to men , like yourself ; who ever else would have stood to charity , and display the same kind of respect of the gentle , and of wisdom oertopping woman power .
then i know why not .
welcome , my lord . i dance attendance here . i think the duke will not be spoke with .
farewell , and if my fortune be gone from this crost , i have a father , you a daughter , lost .
but we have been deceived in your integrity , we have failed in that which seems so .
good or bad news , that she had let com ’ pe be taken in so bluntly ?
is she not proud ? doesnt she not count her blessed , unworthy as she is , that we have crafted so worthy a gentleman to be her bride ?
look , where he stands and glares ! — want ’ , and are there no evil eyes at trial , madam ? come of the lord jesus christ , bessy , to me —
be better suited . these weeds are memories of those worse hours . i let them grow , put them off .
i do the wrong , and first begin to fight . the secret is so great that i set abroach i lay myself in the abyss in the presence only of others .
yet even so , far we are one in fortunes : both fell by our servants , by those men we loved most ; a man of both unnatural and evil in service !
i , that am rudely my queen , and want love ’ s majesty to sit down before a large , rather ambling old man ;
i do come with words as medicinal as true , honest as either , to rid him of that coldness that presses him from sleep .
no , to whitefriars . there was danger to my coming .
you must take your chance , and either not attempt to choose at all
he should , for that , commit your godfathers .
i will seem friendly , as god himself had always instructed me .
then let them anatomize regan . see what they can learn about her heart . is there any cause in nature that makes thesehard hearts ?
how silver - sweet sound lovers ’ , hidden away by night , like softest music to all of their ears !
from who he bringeth sensible regreets , to what he — gifts , he brings with calm and courteous breath — gifts of great and great value .
if spirits can assume both form and suits you come to fright us .
gentlewoman , my lady calls .
alive in triumph — and mercutio dead ! away to heaven , respective god , man , and fire - let your righteous fury be my own , for now .
and so i thank your lordship : never maythe state or fortune fall into my keeping , which is what i have owed to you !
what man is there so much unreasonable , if you had pleased to have defended it with any terms of his own , wanted the modesty to urge the thing held as a ceremony ?
were ’ t my strength to let these hands obey my blood , they are now powerfully enough to dislocate and tear apart my flesh and bones .
and then i wish you to go back to your life ?
he will let him bring his power before sunrising , but let his son george fall into the blind , dead abyss of eternal night .
put up your sword . if this young gentleman have done insult , i take the fault on me .
swear by your triple self , and there ’ s an enormous amount here of credit !
it would always advantage me , now more than ever the bearing of letter did .
at windsor castle , or at harfordwest in wales .
stanley , look to your wife . if she ever comes to richmond , you ought to answer it .
you have your wish ; my will is even this : that now you will carry you home to bed . " " you are a wicked , evil , cruel , falsely , corrupting man !
i ’ m answer that .
“ fair sir , you spet on me on wednesday last ; you never gave me such a day ; another time you called me ’ dog — and for these courtesies i ’ ll lend you this much moneys ? ”
which even they now , demanding after you , denied me to come in — return , and force their way into your very own home .
but let him swear so , and he should not stay , wellt him , or interfere with distaffs .
what would do then , apemantus ?
which it seems , must be sudden too , my noble lords ; for those that tame wild horses , take ' em not in their hands to make them go gentle , but stop their mouths with stubborn bits , and ride ' im away , until they obey the manage .
he let me enjoy it , with the place and honors , during my life ; and , to prove his goodness , tied it by letters - patents : now , wholl take it ?
to mitigate the insult that he gives his uncle , he prettily and loudly taunts himself .
if you never calledst me dog before , i never had a cause . but since i am a dog , beware my fangs .
that is why i keep it lonely , apart . but here it is : prepare to see the life as lively mock as ever still sleep mock death :
once more , take her as you wish .
a good assembly . " why should they come ?
" ah , so he says .
the trick of that voice i do well remember . is ’ t it the king ?
if you do refuse and after your last encounter with my wrath , say so ; the bastard brains with these my proper hands ... " i dash out .
so how tall was she ?
good morning , madam . i need to talk a word with you .
he that dares approach , on him — on you , who can say ? — i will keep my truth and honor firmly .
after all this , how did he keep it to himself ?
and , may i say to your majesty , this pride of hers , against my own advice , has never drawn my love from her ;
then rose again and bowd her to the people : when by the archbishop of canterbury she had all the royal makings of a queen ; as holy oil ,
this night — where the cub - drawn wolf would couch , the lion and the belly - drawn little wolf keep their fur dry — unbonneted he runs , and offers what will take all .

and that he might the king his lord to see whether our daughter were legitimate , respecting this our marriage with the dowager , sometimes our own , wife .
t rue , sir ; i was in love with my bed :
you will not own it .
she had written the letter at sir toby ’ s great importance , in the name of where he had originally married her .
rain sacrificial whisperings in his ear , make sacred even his body is healed , and through him drink the free air .
theres time enough for that ; what do they desire on this push to trouble your joys with like an innocent child . go together , you precious winners all ; your exultation is welcome to every one .
god bless the prince from all the pack of you ! a man like you are of damned bloodsuckers .
why , what a monstrous fellow is he , my dear friend , who ought only to look down on one that is neither known of me , neither knows or loves me !
farewell .
what must be must be .
when the oracle , as was done by apollos great divine , is brought up , will the contents find , something so small that even then will rush to knowledge .
please give me the letter ; let me see what news .
how , my pretty york ? i decided to let me hear it .
those of that nature , to who all sores have fallen under the sun , can come by great fortune , but by contempt of nature .
if i do not , never trust me , take it how you will .
for still we prove much in our vows , but little in our love .
" you speak ’ and i speak it well . — go , father , with your own son . —
he has ; and we wish to see himfor it an archbishop .
by cruel , cruel , i am quite an evil man ! o love ! o life ! not life , but love in death .
for my entire life it is on the life of lear and on cord . ah god , send in time !
but what should this mean ?
sir , i have brought my lord the archbishop , as you commanded me .
kept him a foreign man still ; which so grieved him , that he ran mad and died .
they fell on ; i made good my place : at length they came to the broom - staff to me ; i defied them still : when suddenly a small group of boys behind me , loose from their ropes , delivered them with a shower of pebbles ,
you leave me alone .
and lessened be that small , god i will tell him ! my honor , state , and the highest honor is given back to me .
have we marched on without any difficulty , without going very far into the wilds of the land
i know your lady does not love her husband . i am sure of that .
. i ’ ll serve this duke . " " you ought to have chosen me as an eunuch to him .
since i am crept in favor with myself , i will maintain it with some little cost .
a glooming peace this morning with it brings . the sun for sorrow will not show his head .
how do you now ?
to deal with the fretful things . to hope that the winds blow the earth into the sea or swell the sky into the water , in the main , that things might change or end .
no , madam . we have already prepared for such things as are behooveful for our state tomorrow . so please you , let me now be left alone ,
even so . — cover their faces .
things have fall ’ n out , sir , so unluckily , that we have had no time to move our daughter .
the possibility of these things being by circumstances partly laid open , if ever , hermione , who is true to the true loyalty , and allegiance of a true subject , do advice and help them , for their better safety , to be carried safely away by night .
